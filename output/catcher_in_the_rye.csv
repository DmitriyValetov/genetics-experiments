40,the catcher in the rye by j d salinger
363,if you really want to hear about it the first thing youll probably want to know is where i was born an what my lousy childhood was like and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me and all that david copperfield kind of crap but i dont feel like going into it if you want to know the truth
171,in the first place that stuff bores me and in the second place my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if i told anything pretty personal about them
66,theyre quite touchy about anything like that especially my father
74,theyre nice and allim not saying thatbut theyre also touchy as hell
85,besides im not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything
172,ill just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last christmas just before i got pretty rundown and had to come out here and take it easy
27,i mean thats all i told db
35,about and hes my brother and all
16,hes in hollywood
113,that isnt too far from this crumby place and he comes over and visits me practically every week end
67,hes going to drive me home when i go home next month maybe
20,he just got a jaguar
84,one of those little english jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour
44,it cost him damn near four thousand bucks
28,hes got a lot of dough now
15,he didnt use to
58,he used to be just a regular writer when he was home
101,he wrote this terrific book of short stories the secret goldfish in case you never heard of him
47,the best one in it was the secret goldfish
131, it was about this little kid that wouldnt let anybody look at his goldfish because hed bought it with his own money
11,it killed me
49,now hes out in hollywood db being a prostitute
46,if theres one thing i hate its the movies
29,dont even mention them to me
65,where i want to start telling is the day i left pencey prep
57,pencey prep is this school thats in agerstown pennsylvania
25,you probably heard of it
35,youve probably seen the ads anyway
119,they advertise in about a thousand magazines always showing some hotshot guy on a horse jumping over a fence
70,like as if all you ever did at pencey was play polo all the time
58,i never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place
144,and underneath the guy on the horses picture it always says since  we have been molding boys into splendid clearthinking young men
22, strictly for the birds
82,they dont do any damn more molding at pencey than they do at any other school
78,and i didnt know anybody there that was splendid and clearthinking and all
14,maybe two guys
12,if that many
45,and they probably came to pencey that way
68,anyway it was the saturday of the football game with saxon hall
81,the game with saxon hall was supposed to be a very big deal around pencey
121,it was the last game of the year and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old pencey didnt win
199,i remember around three oclock that afternoon i was standing way the hell up on top of thomsen hill right next to this crazy cannon that was in the revolutionary war and all
123,you could see the whole field from there and you could see the two teams bashing each other all over the place
312,you couldnt see the grandstand too hot but you could hear them all yelling deep and terrific on the pencey side because practically the whole school except me was there and scrawny and faggy on the saxon hall side because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them
