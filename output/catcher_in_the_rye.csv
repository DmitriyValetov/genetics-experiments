40,the catcher in the rye by j d salinger
363,if you really want to hear about it the first thing youll probably want to know is where i was born an what my lousy childhood was like and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me and all that david copperfield kind of crap but i dont feel like going into it if you want to know the truth
171,in the first place that stuff bores me and in the second place my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if i told anything pretty personal about them
66,theyre quite touchy about anything like that especially my father
74,theyre nice and allim not saying thatbut theyre also touchy as hell
85,besides im not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything
172,ill just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last christmas just before i got pretty rundown and had to come out here and take it easy
27,i mean thats all i told db
35,about and hes my brother and all
16,hes in hollywood
113,that isnt too far from this crumby place and he comes over and visits me practically every week end
67,hes going to drive me home when i go home next month maybe
20,he just got a jaguar
84,one of those little english jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour
44,it cost him damn near four thousand bucks
28,hes got a lot of dough now
15,he didnt use to
58,he used to be just a regular writer when he was home
101,he wrote this terrific book of short stories the secret goldfish in case you never heard of him
47,the best one in it was the secret goldfish
131, it was about this little kid that wouldnt let anybody look at his goldfish because hed bought it with his own money
11,it killed me
49,now hes out in hollywood db being a prostitute
46,if theres one thing i hate its the movies
29,dont even mention them to me
65,where i want to start telling is the day i left pencey prep
57,pencey prep is this school thats in agerstown pennsylvania
25,you probably heard of it
35,youve probably seen the ads anyway
119,they advertise in about a thousand magazines always showing some hotshot guy on a horse jumping over a fence
70,like as if all you ever did at pencey was play polo all the time
58,i never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place
144,and underneath the guy on the horses picture it always says since  we have been molding boys into splendid clearthinking young men
22, strictly for the birds
82,they dont do any damn more molding at pencey than they do at any other school
78,and i didnt know anybody there that was splendid and clearthinking and all
14,maybe two guys
12,if that many
45,and they probably came to pencey that way
68,anyway it was the saturday of the football game with saxon hall
81,the game with saxon hall was supposed to be a very big deal around pencey
121,it was the last game of the year and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old pencey didnt win
199,i remember around three oclock that afternoon i was standing way the hell up on top of thomsen hill right next to this crazy cannon that was in the revolutionary war and all
123,you could see the whole field from there and you could see the two teams bashing each other all over the place
312,you couldnt see the grandstand too hot but you could hear them all yelling deep and terrific on the pencey side because practically the whole school except me was there and scrawny and faggy on the saxon hall side because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them
60,there were never many girls at all at the football games
54,only seniors were allowed to bring girls with them
57,it was a terrible school no matter how you looked at it
219,i like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around once in a while even if theyre only scratching their arms or blowing their noses or even just giggling or something
160,old selma thurmershe was the headmasters daughtershowed up at the games quite often but she wasnt exactly the type that drove you mad with desire
35,she was a pretty nice girl though
96,i sat next to her once in the bus from agerstown and we sort of struck up a conversation
10,i liked her
193,she had a big nose and her nails were all bitten down and bleedylooking and she had on those damn falsies that point all over the place but you felt sort of sorry for her
111,what i liked about her she didnt give you a lot of horse manure about what a great guy her father was
46,she probably knew what a phony slob he was
157,the reason i was standing way up on thomsen hill instead of down at the game was because id just got back from new york with the fencing team
45,i was the goddam manager of the fencing team
13,very big deal
102,wed gone in to new york that morning for this fencing meet with mcburney school
27,only we didnt have the meet
72,i left all the foils and equipment and stuff on the goddam subway
20,it wasnt all my fault
76,i had to keep getting up to look at this map so wed know where to get off
79,so we got back to pencey around twothirty instead of around dinnertime
66,the whole team ostracized me the whole way back on the train
30,it was pretty funny in a way
129,the other reason i wasnt down at the game was because i was on my way to say goodby to old spencer my history teacher
111,he had the grippe and i figured i probably wouldnt see him again till christmas vacation started
72,he wrote me this note saying he wanted to see me before i went home
35,he knew i wasnt coming back to pencey
34,i forgot to tell you about that
18,they kicked me out
146,i wasnt supposed to come back after christmas vacation on account of i was flunking four subjects and not applying myself and all
173,they gave me frequent warning to start applying myselfespecially around midterms when my parents came up for a conference with old thurmerbut i didnt do it
16,so i got the ax
52,they give guys the ax quite frequently at pencey
44,it has a very good academic rating pencey
14,it really does
109,anyway it was december and all and it was cold as a witchs teat especially on top of that stupid hill
56,i only had on my reversible and no gloves or anything
156,the week before that somebodyd stolen my camelshair coat right out of my room with my furlined gloves right in the pocket and all
28,pencey was full of crooks
103,quite a few guys came from these very wealthy families but it was full of crooks anyway
67,the more expensive a school is the more crooks it hasim not kidding
114,anyway i kept standing next to that crazy cannon looking down at the game and freezing my ass off
42,only i wasnt watching the game too much
85,what i was really hanging around for i was trying to feel some kind of a goodby
77,i mean ive left schools and places i didnt even know i was leaving them
11,i hate that
112,i dont care if its a sad goodby or a bad goodby but when i leave a place i like to know im leaving it
32,if you dont you feel even worse
12,i was lucky
93,all of a sudden i thought of something that helped make me know i was getting the hell out
178,i suddenly remembered this time in around october that i and robert tichener and paul campbell were chucking a football around in front of the academic building
40,they were nice guys especially tichener
114,it was just before dinner and it was getting pretty dark out but we kept chucking the ball around anyway
142,it kept getting darker and darker and we could hardly see the ball any more but we didnt want to stop doing what we were doing
17,finally we had to
179,this teacher that taught biology mr zambesi stuck his head out of this window in the academic building and told us to go back to the dorm and get ready for dinner
124,if i get a chance to remember that kind of stuff i can get a goodby when i need oneat least most of the time i can
133,as soon as i got it i turned around and started running down the other side of the hill toward old spencers house
29,he didnt live on the campus
32,he lived on anthony wayne avenue
89,i ran all the way to the main gate and then i waited a second till i got my breath
47,i have no wind if you want to know the truth
59,im quite a heavy smoker for one thingthat is i used to be
24,they made me cut it out
55,another thing i grew six and a half inches last year
36,thats also how i practically got tb
62,and came out here for all these goddam checkups and stuff
25,im pretty healthy though
58,anyway as soon as i got my breath back i ran across route 
52,it was icy as hell and i damn near fell down
72,i dont even know what i was running fori guess i just felt like it
69,after i got across the road i felt like i was sort of disappearing
169,it was that kind of a crazy afternoon terrifically cold and no sun out or anything and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road
68,boy i rang that doorbell fast when i got to old spencers house
18,i was really frozen
65,my ears were hurting and i could hardly move my fingers at all
74,cmon cmon i said right out loud almost somebody open the door
33, finally old mrs spencer opened
81,they didnt have a maid or anything and they always opened the door themselves
31,they didnt have too much dough
20, mrs spencer said
22,how lovely to see you
12,come in dear
23,are you frozen to death
34, i think she was glad to see me
13,she liked me
22,at least i think she did
33,boy did i get in that house fast
16,how are you mrs
40,  let me take your coat dear she said
49,she didnt hear me ask her how mr spencer was
19,she was sort of deaf
94,she hung up my coat in the hall closet and i sort of brushed my hair back with my hand
72,i wear a crew cut quite frequently and i never have to comb it much
17,howve you been mrs
40, i said again only louder so shed hear me
23,ive been just fine holden
29, she closed the closet door
17,how have you been
86, the way she asked me i knew right away old spencerd told her id been kicked out
11,fine i said
15,hows mr spencer
22,he over his grippe yet
52,holden hes behaving like a perfecti dont know what
20,hes in his room dear
10,go right in
47,      they each had their own room and all
67,they were both around seventy years old or even more than that
71,they got a bang out of things thoughin a haifassed way of course
58,i know that sounds mean to say but i dont mean it mean
175,i just mean that i used to think about old spencer quite a lot and if you thought about him too much you wondered what the heck he was still living for
249,i mean he was all stooped over and he had very terrible posture and in class whenever he dropped a piece of chalk at the blackboard some guy in the first row always had to get up and pick it up and hand it to him
25,thats awful in my opinion
133,but if you thought about him just enough and not too much you could figure it out that he wasnt doing too bad for himself
210,for instance one sunday when some other guys and i were over there for hot chocolate he showed us this old beatup navajo blanket that he and mrs spencerd bought off some indian in yellowstone park
62,you could tell old spencerd got a big bang out of buying it
17,thats what i mean
108,you take somebody old as hell like old spencer and they can get a big bang out of buying a blanket
86,his door was open but i sort of knocked on it anyway just to be polite and all
33,i could see where he was sitting
98,he was sitting in a big leather chair all wrapped up in that blanket i just told you about
35,he looked over at me when i knocked
11,come in boy
40, he was always yelling outside class
32,it got on your nerves sometimes
52,the minute i went in i was sort of sorry id come
137,he was reading the atlantic monthly and there were pills and medicine all over the place and everything smelled like vicks nose drops
23,it was pretty depressing
46,im not too crazy about sick people anyway
162,what made it even more depressing old spencer had on this very sad ratty old bathrobe that he was probably born in or something
79,i dont much like to see old guys in their pajamas and bathrobes anyway
43,their bumpy old chests are always showing
14,and their legs
72,old guys legs at beaches and places always look so white and unhairy
16,hello sir i said
17,i got your note
11,thanks a lot
130, hed written me this note asking me to stop by and say goodby before vacation started on account of i wasnt coming back
32,you didnt have to do all that
42,id have come over to say goodby anyway
47, have a seat there boy old spencer said
17,he meant the bed
17,i sat down on it
21,hows your grippe sir
80,  mboy if i felt any better id have to send for the doctor old spencer said
20,that knocked him out
35,he started chuckling like a madman
88,then he finally straightened himself out and said why arent you down at the game
42,i thought this was the day of the big game
70,only i just got back from new york with the fencing team i said
29,boy his bed was like a rock
37,he started getting serious as hell
14,i knew he would
22,so youre leaving us eh
12,i guess i am
54,   he started going into this nodding routine
67,you never saw anybody nod as much in your life as old spencer did
166,you never knew if he was nodding a lot because he was thinking and all or just because he was a nice old guy that didnt know his ass from his elbow
37,what did dr thurmer say to you boy
42,i understand you had quite a little chat
13,  yes we did
14,we really did
51,i was in his office for around two hours i guess
21,  whatd he say to you
38,well about life being a game and all
55,and how you should play it according to the rules
28,he was pretty nice about it
48,i mean he didnt hit the ceiling or anything
58,he just kept talking about life being a game and all
19, life is a game boy
53,life is a game that one plays according to the rules
13,i know it is
12,  game my ass
93,if you get on the side where all the hotshots are then its a game all rightill admit that
95,but if you get on the other side where there arent any hotshots then whats a game about it
47,has dr thurmer written to your parents yet
19, old spencer asked me
42,he said he was going to write them monday
46,  have you yourself communicated with them
112,   no sir i havent communicated with them because ill probably see them wednesday night when i get home
45, and how do you think theyll take the news
45,theyll be pretty irritated about it i said
17,they really will
47,this is about the fourth school ive gone to
16, i shook my head
28,i shake my head quite a lot
15,i also say boy
11, quite a lot
107,partly because i have a lousy vocabulary and partly because i act quite young for my age sometimes
87,i was sixteen then and im seventeen now and sometimes i act like im about thirteen
79,its really ironical because im six foot two and a half and i have gray hair
10,i really do
76,the one side of my headthe right sideis full of millions of gray hairs
38,ive had them ever since i was a kid
66,and yet i still act sometimes like i was only about twelve
42,everybody says that especially my father
41,its partly true too but it isnt all true
42,people always think somethings all true
94,i dont give a damn except that i get bored sometimes when people tell me to act my age
84,sometimes i act a lot older than i ami really dobut people never notice it
28,people never notice anything
36,old spencer started nodding again
33,he also started picking his nose
106,he made out like he was only pinching it but he was really getting the old thumb right in there
97,i guess he thought it was all right to do because it was only me that was in the room
88,i didnt care except that its pretty disgusting to watch somebody pick their nose
143,then he said i had the privilege of meeting your mother and dad when they had their little chat with dr thurmer some weeks ago
21,theyre grand people
13, yes they are
16,theyre very nice
24,theres a word i really hate
10,its a phony
37,i could puke every time i hear it
122,then all of a sudden old spencer looked like he had something very good something sharp as a tack to say to me
52,he sat up more in his chair and sort of moved around
26,it was a false alarm though
102,all he did was lift the atlantic monthly off his lap and try to chuck it on the bed next to me
60,it was only about two inches away but he missed anyway
53,i got up and picked it up and put it down on the bed
66,all of a sudden then i wanted to get the hell out of the room
45,i could feel a terrific lecture coming on
188,i didnt mind the idea so much but i didnt feel like being lectured to and smell vicks nose drops and look at old spencer in his pajamas and bathrobe all at the same time
14,i really didnt
20,it started all right
31,whats the matter with you boy
18, old spencer said
39,he said it pretty tough too for him
40,how many subjects did you carry this term
33,and how many are you failing in
43, i moved my ass a little bit on the bed
39,it was the hardest bed i ever sat on
137,i passed english all right i said because i had all that beowulf and lord randal my son stuff when i was at the whooton school
117,i mean i didnt have to do any work in english at all hardly except write compositions once in a while
28,  he wasnt even listening
60,he hardly ever listened to you when you said something
67,i flunked you in history because you knew absolutely nothing
16,   i know that sir
15,boy i know it
18,you couldnt help it
43,  absolutely nothing he said over again
39,thats something that drives me crazy
79,when people say something twice that way after you admit it the first time
28,then he said it three times
25,but absolutely nothing
75,i doubt very much if you opened your textbook even once the whole term
17,tell the truth boy
71,  well i sort of glanced through it a couple of times i told him
33,i didnt want to hurt his feelings
24,he was mad about history
28,you glanced through it eh
22, he saidvery sarcastic
58,your ah exam paper is over there on top of my chiffonier
19,on top of the pile
20,bring it here please
128,  it was a very dirty trick but i went over and brought it over to himi didnt have any alternative or anything
39,then i sat down on his cement bed again
87,boy you cant imagine how sorry i was getting that id stopped by to say goodby to him
73,he started handling my exam paper like it was a turd or something
68,we studied the egyptians from november th to december nd he said
66,you chose to write about them for the optional essay question
48,would you care to hear what you had to say
30, no sir not very much i said
26,he read it anyway though
60,you cant stop a teacher when they want to do something
14,they just do it
44,he stopped reading and put my paper down
36,i was beginning to sort of hate him
88,your essay shall we say ends there he said in this very sarcastic voice
101,you wouldnt     the egyptians are extremely interesting to us today for      various reasons
223,modern science would still like to know what      the secret ingredients were that the egyptians used when they     wrapped up dead people so that their faces would not rot for     innumerable centuries
109,this interesting riddle is still quite     a challenge to modern science in the twentieth century
126,the egyptians were an ancient race of caucasians residing in     one of the northern sections of africa
90,the latter as we all     know is the largest continent in the eastern hemisphere
45,i had to sit there and listen to that crap
28,it certainly was a dirty trick
34,dear mr spencer he read out loud
41,that is all i know about     the egyptians
102,i cant seem to get very interested in them     although your lectures are very interesting
118,it is all right     with me if you flunk me though as i am flunking everything     else except english anyway
31,respectfully yours holden caulfield
55,think such an old guy would be so sarcastic and all
84,however you dropped me a little note at the bottom of the page he said
20,i know i did i said
101,i said it very fast because i wanted to stop him before he started reading that out loud
23,but you couldnt stop him
30,he was hot as a firecracker
123,he put my goddam paper down then and looked at me like hed just beaten hell out of me in pingpong or  something
76,i dont think ill ever forgive him for reading me that crap out loud
78,i wouldntve read it out loud to him if hed written iti really wouldnt
105,in the first place id only written that damn note so that he wouldnt feel too bad about flunking me
39,do you blame me for flunking you boy
22,i certainly dont i said
59,i wished to hell hed stop calling me boy all the time
76,he tried chucking my exam paper on the bed when he was through with it
32,only he missed again naturally
95,i had to get up again and pick it up and put it on top of the atlantic monthly
39,its boring to do that every two minutes
41,what would you have done in my place
21,tell the truth boy
76,   well you could see he really felt pretty lousy about flunking me
32,so i shot the bull for a while
52,i told him i was a real moron and all that stuff
161,i told him how i wouldve done exactly the same thing if id been in his place and how most people didnt appreciate how tough it is being a teacher
18,that kind of stuff
12,the old bull
96,the funny thing is though i was sort of thinking of something else while i shot the bull
113,i live in new york and i was thinking about the lagoon in central park down near central park south
110,i was wondering if it would be frozen over when i got home and if it was where did the ducks go
86,i was wondering where the ducks went when the lagoon got all icy and frozen over
91,i wondered if some guy came in a truck and took them away to a zoo or something
25,or if they just flew away
16,im lucky though
100,i mean i could shoot the old bull to old spencer and think about those ducks at the same time
65,you dont have to think too hard when you talk to a teacher
78,all of a sudden though he interrupted me while i was shooting the bull
31,he was always interrupting you
38,how do you feel about all this boy
30,id be very interested to know
16,very interested
53,  you mean about my flunking out of pencey and all
47,i sort of wished hed cover up his bumpy chest
30,it wasnt such a beautiful view
108,if im not mistaken i believe you also had some difficulty at the whooton school and at elkton hills
54, he didnt say it just sarcastic but sort of nasty too
61,i didnt have too much difficulty at elkton hills i told him
42,i didnt exactly flunk out or anything
20,i just quit sort of
14, why may i ask
29,oh well its a long story sir
31,i mean its pretty complicated
59, i didnt feel like going into the whole thing with him
38,he wouldnt have understood it anyway
29,it wasnt up his alley at all
98,one of the biggest reasons i left elkton hills was because i was surrounded by phonies
37,they were coming in the goddam window
112,for instance they had this headmaster mr haas that was the phoniest bastard i ever met in my life
33,ten times worse than old thurmer
125,on sundays for instance old haas went around shaking hands with everybodys parents when they drove up to school
34,hed be charming as hell and all
59,except if some boy had little old funnylooking parents
61,you shouldve seen the way he did with my roommates parents
427,i mean if a boys mother was sort of fat or cornylooking or something and if somebodys father was one of those guys that wear those suits with very big shoulders and corny blackandwhite shoes then old hans would just shake hands with them and give them a phony smile and then hed go talk for maybe a half an hour with somebody elses parents
27,i cant stand that stuff
18,it drives me crazy
37,it makes me so depressed i go crazy
35,i hated that goddam elkton hills
62,old spencer asked me something then but i didnt hear him
31,i was thinking about old haas
57,do you have any particular qualms about leaving pencey
38,   oh i have a few qualms all right
16,but not too many
14,not yet anyway
39,i guess it hasnt really hit me yet
34,it takes things a while to hit me
65,all im doing right now is thinking about going home wednesday
62,  do you feel absolutely no concern for your future boy
51,  oh i feel some concern for my future all right
34, i thought about it for a minute
27,but not too much i guess
22,not too much i guess
26, you will old spencer said
12,you will boy
24,you will when its too late
40,   i didnt like hearing him say that
35,it made me sound dead or something
24,it was very depressing
23,i guess i will i said
53,id like to put some sense in that head of yours boy
20,im trying to help you
29,im trying to help you if i can
18,  he really was too
18,you could see that
83,but it was just that we were too much on opposite sides ot the pole thats all
26,i know you are sir i said
12,thanks a lot
16,i appreciate it
12,i really do
28, i got up from the bed then
65,boy i couldntve sat there another ten minutes to save my life
44,the thing is though i have to get going now
84,i have quite a bit of equipment at the gym i have to get to take home with me
11,i really do
93, he looked up at me and started nodding again with this very serious look on his face
42,i felt sorry as hell for him all of a sudden
296,but i just couldnt hang around there any longer the way we were on opposite sides of the pole and the way he kept missing the bed whenever he chucked something at it and his sad old bathrobe with his chest showing and that grippy smell of vicks nose drops all over the place
27,dont worry about me i said
16,ill be all right
42,im just going through a phase right now
55,everybody goes through phases and all dont they
17, i dont know boy
11,i dont know
47,   i hate it when somebody answers that way
19,sure they do i said
13,i mean it sir
28,please dont worry about me
43, i sort of put my hand on his shoulder
58,wouldnt you like a cup of hot chocolate before you go
90,mrs spencer would be   i would i really would but the thing is i have to get going
29,i have to go right to the gym
12,thanks though
17,thanks a lot sir
22,  then we shook hands
16,and all that crap
36,it made me feel sad as hell though
23,ill drop you a line sir
30,take care of your grippe now
13,  goodby boy
138,   after i shut the door and started back to the living room he yelled something at me but i couldnt exactly hear him
38,im pretty sure he yelled good luck
26, at me  i hope to hell not
21,id never yell good luck
11, at anybody
44,it sounds terrible when you think about it
57,   im the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life
141,if im on my way to the store to buy a magazine even and somebody asks me where im going im liable to say im going to the opera
12,its terrible
117,so when i told old spencer i had to go to the gym and get my equipment and stuff that was a sheer lie
51,i dont even keep my goddam equipment in the gym
89,where i lived at pencey i lived in the ossenburger memorial wing of the new dorms
36,it was only for juniors and seniors
15,i was a junior
25,my roommate was a senior
62,it was named after this guy ossenburger that went to pencey
81,he made a pot of dough in the undertaking business after he got out of pencey
159,what he did he started these undertaking parlors all over the country that you could get members of your family buried for about five bucks apiece
33,you should see old ossenburger
69,he probably just shoves them in a sack and dumps them in the river
83,anyway he gave pencey a pile of dough and they named our wing alter him
189,the first football game of the year he came up to school in this big goddam cadillac and we all had to stand up in the grandstand and give him a locomotivethats a cheer
82,then the next morning in chapel be made a speech that lasted about ten hours
90,he started off with about fifty corny jokes just to show us what a regular guy he was
13,very big deal
155,then he started telling us how he was never ashamed when he was in some kind of trouble or something to get right down his knees and pray to god
77,he told us we should always pray to godtalk to him and allwherever we were
64,he told us we ought to think of jesus as our buddy and all
41,he said he talked to jesus all the time
34,even when he was driving his car
14,that killed me
112,i just see the big phony bastard shifting into first gear and asking jesus to send him a few more stiffs
65,the only good part of his speech was right in the middle of it
200,he was telling us all about what a swell guy he was what a hotshot and all then all of a sudden this guy sitting in the row in front of me edgar marsalla laid this terrific fart
95,it was a very crude thing to do in chapel and all but it was also quite amusing
10,old marsalla
30,he damn near blew the roof off
224,hardly anybody laughed out loud and old ossenburger made out like he didnt even hear it but old thurmer the headmaster was sitting right next to him on the rostrum and all and you could tell he heard it
14,boy was he sore
156,he didnt say anything then but the next night he made us have compulsory study hall in the academic building and he came up and made a speech
92,he said that the boy that had created the disturbance in chapel wasnt fit to go to pencey
137,we tried to get old marsalla to rip off another one right while old thurmer was making his speech but be wasnt in the right mood
37,anyway thats where i lived at pencey
49,old ossenburger memorial wing in the new dorms
156,it was pretty nice to get back to my room after i left old spencer because everybody was down at the game and the heat was on in our room for a change
21,it felt sort of cosy
144,i took off my coat and my tie and unbuttoned my shirt collar and then i put on this hat that id bought in new york that morning
70,it was this red hunting hat with one of those very very long peaks
136,i saw it in the window of this sports store when we got out of the subway just after i noticed id lost all the goddam foils
23,it only cost me a buck
117,the way i wore it i swung the old peak way around to the backvery corny ill admit but i liked it that way
28,i looked good in it that way
63,then i got this book i was reading and sat down in my chair
38,there were two chairs in every room
52,i had one and my roommate ward stradlater had one
119,the arms were in sad shape because everybody was always sitting on them but they were pretty comfortable chairs
83,the book i was reading was this book i took out of the library by mistake
80,they gave me the wrong book and i didnt notice it till i got back to my room
45,they gave me out of africa by isak dinesen
47,i thought it was going to stink but it didnt
25,it was a very good book
36,im quite illiterate but i read a lot
75,my favorite author is my brother db and my next favorite is ring lardner
96,my brother gave me a book by ring lardner for my birthday just before i went to pencey
185,it had these very funny crazy plays in it and then it had this one story about a traffic cop that falls in love with this very cute girl thats always speeding
61,only hes married the cop so be cant marry her or anything
61,then this girl gets killed because shes always speeding
32,that story just about killed me
71,what i like best is a book thats at least funny once in a while
204,i read a lot of classical books like the return of the native and all and i like them and i read a lot of war books and mysteries and all but they dont knock me out too much
257,what really knocks me out is a book that when youre all done reading it you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it
31,that doesnt happen much though
48,i wouldnt mind calling this isak dinesen up
34,and ring lardner except that db
16,told me hes dead
65,you take that book of human bondage by somerset maugham though
24,i read it last summer
84,its a pretty good book and all but i wouldnt want to call somerset maugham up
77,i dont know he just isnt the kind of guy id want to call up thats all
36,id rather call old thomas hardy up
25,i like that eustacia vye
91,anyway i put on my new hat and sat down and started reading that book out of africa
66,id read it already but i wanted to read certain parts over again
100,id only read about three pages though when i heard somebody coming through the shower curtains
57,even without looking up i knew right away who it was
62,it was robert ackley this guy that roomed right next to me
132,there was a shower right between every two rooms in our wing and about eightyfive times a day old ackley barged in on me
92,he was probably the only guy in the whole dorm besides me that wasnt down at the game
27,he hardly ever went anywhere
27,he was a very peculiar guy
141,he was a senior and hed been at pencey the whole four years and all but nobody ever called him anything except ackley
73, not even herb gale his own roommate ever called him bob or even ack
73, if he ever gets married his own wifell probably call him ackley
100, he was one of these very very tall roundshouldered guyshe was about six fourwith lousy teeth
86,the whole time he roomed next to me i never even once saw him brush his teeth
179,they always looked mossy and awful and he damn near made you sick if you saw him in the dining room with his mouth full of mashed potatoes and peas or something
39,besides that he had a lot of pimples
85,not just on his forehead or his chin like most guys but all over his whole face
47,and not only that he had a terrible personality
31,he was also sort of a nasty guy
49,i wasnt too crazy about him to tell you the truth
131,i could feel him standing on the shower ledge right behind my chair taking a look to see if stradlater was around
86,he hated stradlaters guts and he never came in the room if stradlater was around
36,he hated everybodys guts damn near
58,he came down off the shower ledge and came in the room
78,he always said it like he was terrifically bored or terrifically tired
64,he didnt want you to think he was visiting you or anything
69,he wanted you to think hed come in by mistake for gods sake
42,hi i said but i didnt look up from my book
81,with a guy like ackley if you looked up from your book you were a goner
79,you were a goner anyway but not as quick if you didnt look up right away
147,he started walking around the room very slow and all the way he always did picking up your personal stuff off your desk and chiffonier
61,he always picked up your personal stuff and looked at it
43,boy could he get on your nerves sometimes
18,how was the fencing
57,he just wanted me to quit reading and enjoying myself
42,he didnt give a damn about the fencing
14,we win or what
16,nobody won i said
26,without looking up though
42,he always made you say everything twice
17,nobody won i said
71,i sneaked a look to see what he was fiddling around with on my chiffonier
100,he was looking at this picture of this girl i used to go around with in new york sally hayes
109,he mustve picked up that goddam picture and looked at it at least five thousand times since i got it
72,he always put it back in the wrong place too when he was finished
20,he did it on purpose
14,you could tell
20,nobody won he said
54,   i left the goddam foils and stuff on the subway
29, i still didnt look up at him
31,on the subway for chrissake
21,ya lost them ya mean
35,   we got on the wrong subway
64,i had to keep getting up to look at a goddam map on the wall
46,  he came over and stood right in my light
73,ive read this same sentence about twenty times since you came in
59,  anybody else except ackley wouldve taken the goddam hint
14,not him though
34,think theyll make ya pay for em
37,i dont know and i dont give a damn
48,how bout sitting down or something ackley kid
31,youre right in my goddam light
52, he didnt like it when you called him ackley kid
97, he was always telling me i was a goddam kid because i was sixteen and he was eighteen
43,it drove him mad when i called him ackley kid
25,  he kept standing there
96,he was exactly the kind of a guy that wouldnt get out of your light when you asked him to
70,hed do it finally but it took him a lot longer if you asked him to
23,what the hellya reading
11,goddam book
82,   he shoved my book back with his hand so that he could see the name of it
40,this sentence im reading is terrific
49, i can be quite sarcastic when im in the mood
23,he didnt get it though
100,he started walking around the room again picking up all my personal stuff and stradlaters
46,finally i put my book down on the floor
60,you couldnt read anything with a guy like ackley around
16,it was impossible
95,i slid way the hell down in my chair and watched old ackley making himself at home
91,i was feeling sort of tired from the trip to new york and all and i started yawning
51,then i started horsing around a little bit
78,sometimes i horse around quite a lot just to keep from getting bored
125,what i did was i pulled the old peak of my hunting hat around to the front then pulled it way down over my eyes
34,that way i couldnt see a goddam thing
64,i think im going blind i said in this very hoarse voice
51,mother darling everythings getting so dark in here
10, youre nuts
29,i swear to god ackley said
67,mother darling give me your hand why wont you give me your hand
24, for chrissake grow up
108,   i started groping around in front of me like a blind guy but without getting up or anything
62,i kept saying mother darling why wont you give me your hand
39, i was only horsing around naturally
38,that stuff gives me a bang sometimes
54,besides i know it annoyed hell out of old ackley
42,he always brought out the old sadist in me
42,i was pretty sadistic with him quite often
19,finally i quit though
59,i pulled the peak around to the back again and relaxed
18,who belongsa this
13, ackley said
57,he was holding my roommates knee supporter up to show me
35,that guy ackleyd pick up anything
52,hed even pick up your jock strap or something
32,i told him it was stradlaters
37,so he chucked it on stradlaters bed
67,he got it off stradlaters chiffonier so he chucked it on the bed
60,he came over and sat down on the arm of stradlaters chair
28,he never sat down in a chair
25,just always on the arm
30,where the hellja get that hat
11,   how much
18,   you got robbed
72, he started cleaning his goddam fingernails with the end of a match
46,he was always cleaning his fingernails
19,it was funny in a way
132,his teeth were always mossylooking and his ears were always dirty as hell but he was always cleaning his fingernails
52,i guess he thought that made him a very neat guy
67,he took another look at my hat while he was cleaning them
78,up home we wear a hat like that to shoot deer in for chrissake he said
26,thats a deer shooting hat
17,  like hell it is
32, i took it off and looked at it
54,i sort of closed one eye like i was taking aim at it
37,this is a people shooting hat i said
28,i shoot people in this hat
41, your folks know you got kicked out yet
38, where the hells stradlater at anyway
20,   down at the game
13,hes got a date
33,i was yawning all over the place
41,for one thing the room was too damn hot
19,it made you sleepy
59,at pencey you either froze to death or died of the heat
33,the great stradlater ackley said
37,lend me your scissors a second willya
14,ya got em handy
24,i packed them already
38,theyre way in the top of the closet
27,   get em a second willya
52, ackley said i got this hangnail i want to cut off
101,  he didnt care if youd packed something or not and had it way in the top of the closet
26,i got them for him though
33,i nearly got killed doing it too
125,the second i opened the closet door stradlaters tennis racketin its wooden press and allfell right on my head
45,it made a big clunk and it hurt like hell
39,it damn near killed old ackley though
55,he started laughing in this very high falsetto voice
107,he kept laughing the whole time i was taking down my suitcase and getting the scissors out for him
115,something like thata guy getting hit on the head with a rock or somethingtickled the pants off ackley
66,you have a damn good sense of humor ackley kid i told him
12,you know that
28, i handed him the scissors
21,lemme be your manager
33,ill get you on the goddam radio
86, i sat down in my chair again and he started cutting his big hornylooking nails
43,how bout using the table or something
29,cut em over the table willya
74,i dont feel like walking on your crumby nails in my bare feet tonight
59, he kept right on cutting them over the floor though
17,what lousy manners
22,whos stradlaters date
102,he was always keeping tabs on who stradlater was dating even though he hated stradlaters guts
12,i dont know
11,   no reason
38,boy i cant stand that sonuvabitch
42,hes one sonuvabitch i really cant stand
19,  hes crazy about you
51,he told me he thinks youre a goddam prince i said
64,i call people a prince quite often when im horsing around
47,it keeps me from getting bored or something
53,hes got this superior attitude all the time ackley said
37,i just cant stand the sonuvabitch
68,youd think he  do you mind cutting your nails over the table hey
97,ive asked you about fifty  hes got this goddam superior attitude all the time ackley said
52,i dont even think the sonuvabitch is intelligent
14,he thinks he is
39,he thinks hes about the most  ackley
12,for chrissake
55,willya please cut your crumby nails over the table
27,ive asked you fifty times
62,  he started cutting his nails over the table for a change
63,the only way he ever did anything was if you yelled at him
24,i watched him for a while
139,then i said the reason youre sore at stradlater is because he said that stuff about brushing your teeth once in a while
48,he didnt mean to insult you for cryin out loud
72,he didnt say it right or anything but he didnt mean anything insulting
114,all he meant was youd look better and feel better if you sort of brushed your teeth once in a while
17,  i brush my teeth
14,dont gimme that
13,  no you dont
34,ive seen you and you dont i said
32,i didnt say it nasty though
39,i felt sort of sorry for him in a way
89,i mean it isnt too nice naturally if somebody tells you you dont brush your teeth
46,stradlaters all right hes not too bad i said
37,you dont know him thats the trouble
33,  i still say hes a sonuvabitch
27,hes a conceited sonuvabitch
54,  hes conceited but hes very generous in some things
20,he really is i said
79,suppose for instance stradlater was wearing a tie or something that you liked
88,say he had a tie on that you liked a helluva lotim just giving you an example now
21,you know what hed do
45,hed probably take it off and give it ta you
15,he really would
22,oryou know what hed do
41,hed leave it on your bed or something
32,but hed give you the goddam tie
51,most guys would probably just hell ackley said
34,if i had his dough i would too
18,   no you wouldnt
16, i shook my head
26,no you wouldnt ackley kid
88,if you had his dough youd be one of the biggest  stop calling me ackley kid god damn it
43,im old enough to be your lousy father
13,  no youre not
48, boy he could really be aggravating sometimes
84,he never missed a chance to let you know you were sixteen and he was eighteen
64,in the first place i wouldnt let you in my goddam family i said
109,well just cut out calling me  all of a sudden the door opened and old stradlater barged in in a big hurry
30,he was always in a big hurry
31,everything was a very big deal
137,he came over to me and gave me these two playful as hell slaps on both cheekswhich is something that can be very annoying
14,listen he said
38,you going out anywheres special tonight
13,  i dont know
37,what the hells it doing outsnowing
33, he had snow all over his coat
91,if youre not going out anyplace special how bout lending me your houndstooth jacket
16, who won the game
19,its only the half
31,were leaving stradlater said
56,no kidding you gonna use your houndstooth tonight or not
49,i spilled some crap all over my gray flannel
90,  no but i dont want you stretching it with your goddam shoulders and all i said
92,we were practically the same heighth but he weighed about twice as much as i did
33,he had these very broad shoulders
19,i wont stretch it
48, he went over to the closet in a big hurry
16,howsa boy ackley
17, he said to ackley
54,he was at least a pretty friendly guy stradlater
95,it was partly a phony kind of friendly but at least he always said hello to ackley and all
52,ackley just sort of grunted when he said howsa boy
73, he wouldnt answer him but he didnt have guts enough not to at least grunt
41,then he said to me i think ill get going
10,see ya later
11,  okay i said
79,he never exactly broke your heart when he went back to his own room
61,old stradlater started taking off his coat and tie and all
43,i think maybe ill take a fast shave he said
29,he had a pretty heavy beard
10,he really did
17,wheres your date
12, i asked him
25,shes waiting in the annex
76, he went out of the room with his toilet kit and towel under his arm
23,no shirt on or anything
88,he always walked around in his bare torso because he thought he had a damn good build
18,i have to admit it
124,   i didnt have anything special to do so i went down to the can and chewed the rag with him while he was shaving
81,we were the only ones in the can because everybody was still down at the game
55,it was hot as hell and the windows were all steamy
63,there were about ten washbowls all right against the wall
30,stradlater had the middle one
119,i sat down on the one right next to him and started turning the cold water on and offthis nervous habit i have
59,stradlater kept whistling song of india while he shaved
228,he had one of those very piercing whistles that are practically never in tune and he always picked out some song thats hard to whistle even if youre a good whistler like song of india or slaughter on tenth avenue
33, he could really mess a song up
85,you remember i said before that ackley was a slob in his personal habits
51,well so was stradlater but in a different way
36,stradlater was more of a secret slob
114,he always looked all right stradlater but for instance you shouldve seen the razor he shaved himself with
72,it was always rusty as hell and full of lather and hairs and crap
33,he never cleaned it or anything
128,he always looked good when he was finished fixing himself up but he was a secret slob anyway if you knew him the way i did
102,the reason he fixed himself up to look good was because he was madly in love with himself
71,he thought he was the handsomest guy in the western hemisphere
43,he was pretty handsome tooill admit it
145,but he was mostly the kind of a handsome guy that if your parents saw his picture in your year book theyd right away say whos this boy
57, i mean he was mostly a year book kind of handsome guy
179,i knew a lot of guys at pencey i thought were a lot handsomer than stradlater but they wouldnt look handsome if you saw their pictures in the year book
64,theyd look like they had big noses or their ears stuck out
36,ive had that experience frequently
124,anyway i was sitting on the washbowl next to where stradlater was shaving sort of turning the water on and off
79,i still had my red hunting hat on with the peak around to the back and all
39,i really got a bang out of that hat
20,hey stradlater said
23,wanna do me a big favor
22,not too enthusiastic
47,he was always asking you to do him a big favor
130,you take a very handsome guy or a guy that thinks hes a real hotshot and theyre always asking you to do them a big favor
130,just because theyre crazy about themseif they think youre crazy about them too and that youre just dying to do them a favor
24,its sort of funny in a way
22,you goin out tonight
10,i might not
10,i dont know
76,   i got about a hundred pages to read for history for monday he said
51,how bout writing a composition for me for english
83,ill be up the creek if i dont get the goddam thing in by monday the reason i ask
11,how bout it
24,  it was very ironical
13,it really was
123,im the one thats flunking out of the goddam place and youre asking me to write you a goddam composition i said
11,yeah i know
76,the thing is though ill be up the creek if i dont get it in
14,be a buddyroo
33,  i didnt answer him right away
54,suspense is good for some bastards like stradlater
23,anything descriptive
57,or something you once lived in or something you know
42,just as long as its descriptive as hell
44, he gave out a big yawn while he said that
58,which is something that gives me a royal pain in the ass
89,i mean if somebody yawns right while theyre asking you to do them a goddam favor
44,just dont do it too good is all he said
101,that sonuvabitch hartzell thinks youre a hotshot in english and he knows youre my roommate
69,so i mean dont stick all the commas and stuff in the right place
55,  thats something else that gives me a royal pain
92,i mean if youre good at writing compositions and somebody starts talking about commas
36,stradlater was always doing that
159,he wanted you to think that the only reason he was lousy at writing compositions was because he stuck all the commas in the wrong place
42,he was a little bit like ackley that way
53,i once sat next to ackley at this basketball game
164,we had a terrific guy on the team howie coyle that could sink them from the middle of the floor without even touching the backboard or anything
91,ackley kept saying the whole goddam game that coyle had a perfect build for basketball
27,god how i hate that stuff
147,i got bored sitting on that washbowl after a while so i backed up a few feet and started doing this tap dance just for the hell of it
27,i was just amusing myself
111,i cant really tapdance or anything but it was a stone floor in the can and it was good for tapdancing
57,i started imitating one of those guys in the movies
25,in one of those musicals
66,i hate the movies like poison but i get a bang imitating them
61,old stradlater watched me in the mirror while he was shaving
23,all i needs an audience
20,im an exhibitionist
35,im the goddarn governors son i said
25,i was knocking myself out
32,tapdancing all over the place
39,he doesnt want me to be a tap dancer
29,he wants me to go to oxford
39,but its in my goddam blood tapdancing
22, old stradlater laughed
40,he didnt have too bad a sense of humor
44,its the opening night of the ziegfeld follies
29, i was getting out of breath
33,i have hardly any wind at all
29,the leading man cant go on
21,hes drunk as a bastard
38,so who do they get to take his place
13,me thats who
34,the little ole goddam governors son
22,  wheredja get that hat
15, stradlater said
22,he meant my hunting hat
27,hed never seen it before
54,i was out of breath anyway so i quit horsing around
67,i took off my hat and looked at it for about the ninetieth time
40,i got it in new york this morning
18,  stradlater nodded
14,sharp he said
73,he was only flattering me though because right away he said listen
42,are ya gonna write that composition for me
14,i have to know
27,  if i get the time i will
25,if i dont i wont i said
62,i went over and sat down at the washbowl next to him again
14,whos your date
11, i asked him
23,im through with that pig
19,give her to me boy
12,shes my type
12,   take her 
19,shes too old for you
210,  all of a suddenfor no good reason really except that i was sort of in the mood for horsing aroundi felt like jumping off the washbowl and getting old stradlater in a half nelson
146,thats a wrestling hold in case you dont know where you get the other guy around the neck and choke him to death if you feel like it
10,so i did it
42,i landed on him like a goddam panther
33,cut it out holden for chrissake
17, stradlater said
32,he didnt feel like horsing around
23,he was shaving and all
50,wuddaya wanna make me docut my goddam head off
25,  i didnt let go though
39,i had a pretty good half nelson on him
38,liberate yourself from my viselike grip

54,her mother belonged to the same club we did i said
66,i used to caddy once in a while just to make some dough
45,i caddyd for her mother a couple of times

38,and run around the goddam house naked
26,with jane around and all
16, stradlater said
25,that really interested him
73,about the booze hound running around the house naked with jane around
33,stradlater was a very sexy bastard
24,she had a lousy childhood
14,im not kidding
41,   that didnt interest stradlater though
34,only very sexy stuff interested him
13,jane gallagher
30,i couldnt get her off my mind
16,i really couldnt
51,i oughta go down and say hello to her at least
53,  why the hell dontcha instead of keep saying it

14,i wasnt either
45,you have to be in the mood for those things
31,i thought she went to shipley
36,i couldve sworn she went to shipley

35,i didnt have anything else to do
23,did she enjoy the game

11,i dont know
73,   did she tell you we used to play checkers all the time or anything
13,  i dont know

54,he was finished combing his goddam gorgeous hair
55,he was putting away all his crumby toilet articles
28,give her my regards willya
57,   okay stradlater said but i knew he probably wouldnt
69,you take a guy like stradlater they never  give your regards to people
97,he went back to the room but i stuck around in the can for a while thinking about old jane
32,then i went back to the room too
82,stradlater was putting on his tie in front of the mirror when i got there
64,he spent around half his goddam life in front of the mirror
63,i sat down in my chair and sort of watched him for a while
39,dont tell her i got kicked out willya
45,  that was one good thing about stradlater
107,you didnt have to explain every goddam little thing with him the way you had to do with ackley
50,mostly i guess because he wasnt too interested
17,thats really why
23,ackley it was different
31,ackley was a very nosy bastard
32,he put on my houndstooth jacket
61,jesus now try not to stretch it all over the place i said
31,id only worn it about  twice
32,where the hells my cigarettes
15,   on the desk
38, he never knew where he left anything
19,under your muffler
48, he put them in his coat pocketmy coat pocket
95,i pulled the peak of my hunting hat around to the front all of a sudden for a change
49,i was getting sort of nervous all of a sudden
24,im quite a nervous guy
49,listen where ya going on your date with her
12, i asked him
11,ya know yet
15,  i dont know
25,new york if we have time
53,she only signed out for ninethirty for chrissake
157,  i didnt like the way he said it so i said the reason she did that she probably just didnt know what a handsome charming bastard you are
79,if shed known she probably wouldve signed out for ninethirty in the morning
30,  goddam right stradlater said
32,you couldnt rile him too easily
22,he was too conceited
13,no kidding now
38,do that composition for me he said
50,he had his coat on and he was all ready to go
78,dont knock yourself out or anything but just make it descriptive as hell
20,  i didnt answer him
18,i didnt feel like it
80,all i said was ask her if she still keeps all her kings in the back row
43,  okay stradlater said but i knew he wouldnt
16,take it easy now
37, he banged the hell out of the room
50,i sat there for about a half hour after he left
53,i mean i just sat in my chair not doing anything
87,i kept thinking about jane and about stradlater having a date with her and all
48,it made me so nervous i nearly went crazy
60,i already told you what a sexy bastard stradlater was
94,all of a sudden ackley barged back in again through the damn shower curtains as usual
64,for once in my stupid life i was really glad to see him
39,he took my mind off the other stuff
164,he stuck around till around dinnertime talking about all the guys at pencey that he hated their guts and squeezing this big pimple on his chin
36,he didnt even use his handkerchief
89,i dont even think the bastard had a handkerchief if you want to know the truth
32,i never saw him use one anyway
60,  we always had the same meal on saturday nights at pencey
64,it was supposed to  be a big deal because they gave you steak
265,ill bet a thousand bucks the reason they did that was because a lot of guys parents came up to school on sunday and old thurmer probably figured everybodys mother would ask their darling boy what he had for dinner last night and hed say steak
13, what a racket
31,you shouldve seen the steaks
74,they were these little hard dry jobs that you could hardly even cut
266,you always got these very lumpy mashed potatoes on steak night and for dessert you got brown betty which nobody ate except maybe the little kids in the lower school that didnt know any betterand guys like ackley that ate everything
58,it was nice though when we got out of the dining room
113,there were about three inches of snow on the ground and it was still coming down like a madman
110,it looked pretty as hell and we all started throwing snowballs and horsing around all over the place
74,it was very childish but everybody was really enjoying themselves
220,i didnt have a date or anything so i and this friend of mine mal brossard that was on the wrestling team decided wed take a bus into agerstown and have a hamburger and maybe see a lousy movie
63,neither of us felt like sitting around on our ass all night
56,i asked mal if he minded if ackley came along with us
156,the reason i asked was because ackley never did anything on saturday night except stay in his room and squeeze his pimples or something
74,mal said he didnt mind but that he wasnt too crazy about the idea
24,he didnt like ackley much
181,anyway we both went to our rooms to get ready and all and while i was putting on my galoshes and crap i yelled over and asked old ackley if he wanted to go to the movies
92,he could hear me all right through the shower curtains but he didnt answer me right away
65,he was the kind of a guy that hates to answer you right away
120,finally he came over through the goddam curtains and stood on the shower ledge and asked who was going besides me
38,he always had to know who was going
176,i swear if that guy was shipwrecked somewhere and you rescued him in a goddam boat hed want to know who the guy was that was rowing it before hed even get in
36,i told him mal brossard was going
20,he said that bastard 
11,wait a second
44, youd think he was doing you a big favor
41,it took him about five hours to get ready
111,while he was doing it i went over to my window and opened it and packed a snowball with my bare hands
36,the snow was very good for packing
37,i didnt throw it at anything though
20,i started to throw it
43,at a car that was parked across the street
19,but i changed my mind
33,the car looked so nice and white
85,then i started to throw it at a hydrant but that looked too nice and white too
39,finally i didnt throw it at anything
100,all i did was close the window and walk around the room with the snowball packing it harder
103,a little while later i still had it with me when i and brossnad and ackley got on the bus
60,the bus driver opened the doors and made me throw it out
76,i told him i wasnt going to chuck it at anybody but he wouldnt believe me
27,people never believe you
217,brossard and ackley both had seen the picture that was playing so all we did we just had a couple of hamburgers and played the pinball machine for a little while then took the bus back to pencey
48,i didnt care about not seeing the movie anyway
75,it was supposed to be a comedy with cary grant in it and all that crap
77,besides id been to the movies with brossard and ackley before
66,they both laughed like hyenas at stuff that wasnt even funny
57,i didnt even enjoy sitting next to them in the movies
72,it was only about a quarter to nine when we got back to the dorm
94,old brossard was a bridge fiend and he started looking around the dorm for a game
56,old ackley parked himself in my room just for a change
124,only instead of sitting on the arm of stradlaters chair he laid down on my bed with his face right on my pillow and all
86,he started talking in this very monotonous voice and picking at all his pimples
69,i dropped about a thousand hints but i couldnt get rid of him
163,all he did was keep talking in this very monotonous voice about some babe he was supposed to have had sexual intercourse with the summer before
56,hed already told me about it about a hundred times
40,every time he told it it was different
130,one minute hed be giving it to her in his cousins buick the next minute hed be giving it to her under some boardwalk
35,it was all a lot of crap naturally
36,he was a virgin if ever i saw one
46,i doubt if he ever even gave anybody a feel
183,anyway finally i had to come right out and tell him that i had to write a composition for stradlater and that he had to clear the hell out so i could concentrate
56,he finally did but he took his time about it as usual
113,after he left i put on my pajamas and bathrobe and my old hunting hat and started writing the composition
133,the thing was i couldnt think of a room or a house or anything to describe the way stradlater said he had to have
65,im not too crazy about describing rooms and houses anyway
64,so what i did i wrote about my brother allies baseball mitt
35,it was a very descriptive subject
11,it really was
54,my brother allie had this lefthanded fielders mitt
16,he was lefthanded
146,the thing that was descriptive about it though was that he had poems written all over the fingers and the pocket and everywhere
12,in green ink
112,he wrote them on it so that hed have something to read when he was in the field and nobody was up at bat
12,hes dead now
67,he got leukemia and died when we were up in maine on july  
20,youd have liked him
87,he was two years younger than i was but he was about fifty times as intelligent
33,he was terrifically intelligent
139,his teachers were always writing letters to my mother telling her what a pleasure it was having a boy like allie in their class
43,and they werent just shooting the crap
20,they really meant it
79,but it wasnt just that he was the most intelligent member in the family
40,he was also the nicest in lots of ways
29,he never got mad at anybody
119,people with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily but allie never did and he had very red hair
43,ill tell you what kind of red hair he had
56,i started playing golf when i was only ten years old
151,i remember once the summer i was around twelve teeing off and all and having a hunch that if i turned around all of a sudden id see allie
233,so i did and sure enough he was sitting on his bike outside the fencethere was this fence that went all around the courseand he was sitting there about a hundred and fifty yards behind me watching me tee off
35,thats the kind of red hair he had
30,god he was a nice kid though
118,he used to laugh so hard at something he thought of at the dinner table that he just about fell off his chair
128,i was only thirteen and they were going to have me psychoanalyzed and all because i broke all the windows in the garage
18,i dont blame them
14,i really dont
124,i slept in the garage the night he died and i broke all the goddam windows with my fist just for the hell of it
168,i even tried to break all the windows on the station wagon we had that summer but my hand was already broken and everything by that time and i couldnt do it
122,it was a very stupid thing to do ill admit but i hardly didnt even know i was doing it and you didnt know allie
176,my hand still hurts me once in a while when it rains and all and i cant make a real fist any morenot a tight one i meanbut outside of that i dont care much
87,i mean im not going to be a goddam surgeon or a violinist or anything anyway
61,anyway thats what i wrote stradlaters composition about
26,old allies baseball mitt
117,i happened to have it with me in my suitcase so i got it out and copied down the poems that were written on it
116,all i had to do was change allies name so that nobody would know it was my brother and not stradlaters
88,i wasnt too crazy about doing it but i couldnt think of anything else descriptive
41,besides i sort of liked writing about it
118,it took me about an hour because i had to use stradlaters lousy typewriter and it kept jamming on me
84,the reason i didnt use my own was because id lent it to a guy down the hall
53,it was around tenthirty i guess when i finished it
65,i wasnt tired though so i looked out the window for a while
128,it wasnt snowing out any more but every once in a while you could hear a car somewhere not being able to get started
41,you could also hear old ackley snoring
71,right through the goddam shower curtains you could hear him
82,he had sinus trouble and he couldnt breathe too hot when he was asleep
34,that guy had just about everything
67,sinus trouble pimples lousy teeth halitosis crumby fingernails
62,you had to feel a little sorry for the crazy sonuvabitch
38,   some things are hard to remember
76,im thinking now of when stradlater got back from his date with jane
126,i mean i cant remember exactly what i was doing when i heard his goddam stupid footsteps coming down the corridor
80,i probably was still looking out the window but i swear i cant remember
34,i was so damn worried thats why
61,when i really worry about something i dont just fool around
69,i even have to go to the bathroom when i worry about something
13,only i dont go
19,im too worried to go
47,i dont want to interrupt my worrying to go
51,if you knew stradlater youd have been worried too
89,id doubledated with that bastard a couple of times and i know what im talking about
19,he was unscrupulous
14,he really was
124,anyway the corridor was all linoleum and all and you could hear his goddam footsteps coming right towards the room
97,i dont even remember where i was sitting when he came inat the window or in my chair or his
24,i swear i cant remember
43,he came in griping about how cold it was out
41,then he said where the hell is everybody
38,its like a goddam morgue around here
35, i didnt even bother to answer him
188,if he was so goddam stupid not to realize it was saturday night and everybody was out or asleep or home for the week end i wasnt going to break my neck telling him
32,he started getting undressed
43,he didnt say one goddam word about jane
34,neither did i i just watched him
64,all he did was thank me for letting him wear my houndstooth
56,he hung it up on a hanger and put it in the closet
98,then when he was taking off his tie he asked me if id written his goddam composition for him
43,i told him it was over on his goddam bed
65,he walked over and read it while he was unbuttoning his shirt
152,he stood there reading it and sort of stroking his bare chest and stomach with this very stupid expression on his face
50,he was always stroking his stomach or his chest
26,he was mad about himself
48,all of a sudden he said for chrissake holden
38,this is about a goddam baseball glove
11,cold as hell
23,wuddaya mean so what
73,i told ya it had to be about a goddam room or a house or something
36,  you said it had to be descriptive
65,what the hells the difference if its about a baseball glove
11,  god damn it
21, he was sore as hell
22,he was really furious
40,you always do everything backasswards
17, he looked at me
61,no wonder youre flunking the hell out of here he said
58,you dont do one damn thing the way youre supposed to
19,not one damn thing
42,  all right give it back to me then i said
60,i went over and pulled it right out of his goddam hand
18,then i tore it up
27,what the hellja do that for
23,i didnt even answer him
41,i just threw the pieces in the wastebasket
79,then i lay down on my bed and we both didnt say anything for a long time
84,he got all undressed down to his shorts and i lay on my bed and lit a cigarette
148,you werent allowed to smoke in the dorm but you could do it late at night when everybody was asleep or out and nobody could smell the smoke
41,besides i did it to annoy stradlater
48,it drove him crazy when you broke any rules
28,he never smoked in the dorm
14,it was only me
58,he still didnt say one single solitary word about jane
90,so finally i said youre back pretty goddam late if she only signed out for ninethirty
35,did you make her be late signing in
100,  he was sitting on the edge of his bed cutting his goddam toenails when i asked him that
23,coupla minutes he said
61,who the hell signs out for ninethirty on a saturday night
21, god how i hated him
24,did you go to new york
78,how the hell could we go to new york if she only signed out for ninethirty
12, thats tough
22,   he looked up at me
85,listen he said if youre gonna smoke in the room how bout going down to the can and do it
99,you may be getting the hell out of here but i have to stick around long enough to graduate
14,  i ignored him
13,i really did
40,i went right on smoking like a madman
89,all i did was sort of turn over on my side and watched him cut his damn toenails
11,what a school
101,you were always watching somebody cut their damn toenails or squeeze their pimples or something
26,did you give her my regards
12, i asked him
33,   the hell he did the bastard
13,whatd she say
69,did you ask her if she still keeps all her kings in the back row
21,  no i didnt ask her
71,what the hell ya think we did all nightplay checkers for chrissake
24, i didnt even answer him
20,god how i hated him
50,if you didnt go to new york whered ya go with her
37, i asked him after a little while
66,i could hardly keep my voice from shaking all over the place
25,boy was i getting nervous
47,i just had a feeling something had gone funny
47,he was finished cutting his damn toenails
98,so he got up from the bed in just his damn shorts and all and started getting very damn playful
116,he came over to my bed and started leaning over me and taking these playful as hell socks at my shoulder
18,cut it out i said
54,whered you go with her if you didnt go to new york
31,we just sat in the goddam car
86, he gave me another one of those playtul stupid little socks on the shoulder
18,cut it out i said
50,   ed banky was the basketball coach at pencey
160,old stradlater was one of his pets because he was the center on the team and ed banky always let him borrow his car when he wanted it
121,it wasnt allowed for students to borrow faculty guys cars but all the athletic bastards stuck together
74,in every school ive gone to all the athletic bastards stick together
70,stradlater kept taking these shadow punches down at my shoulder
65,he had his toothbrush in his hand and he put it in his mouth
12,whatd you do
40,give her the time in ed bankys goddam car
39, my voice was shaking something awful
20,what a thing to say
40,want me to wash your mouth out with soap
41,   thats a professional secret buddy
43,  this next part i dont remember so hot
232,all i know is i got up from the bed like i was going down to the can or something and then i tried to sock him with all my might right smack in the toothbrush so it would split his goddam throat open
14,only i missed
16,i didnt connect
73,all i did was sort of get him on the side of the head or something
63,it probably hurt him a little bit but not as much as i wanted
116,it probably wouldve hurt him a lot but i did it with my right hand and i cant make a good fist with that hand
42,on account of that injury i told you about
115,anyway the next thing i knew i was on the goddam floor and he was sitting on my chest with his face all red
76,that is he had his goddam knees on my chest and he weighed about a ton
70,he had hold of my wrists too so i couldnt take another sock at him
15,idve killed him
37,what the hells the matter with you
72, he kept saying and his stupid race kept getting redder and redder
48,get your lousy knees off my chest i told him
21,i was almost bawling
12,i really was
39,go on get off a me ya crumby bastard
26,  he wouldnt do it though
109,he kept holding onto my wrists and i kept calling him a sonuvabitch and all for around ten hours
53,i can hardly even remember what all i said to him
76,i told him he thought he could give the time to anybody he felt like
157,i told him he didnt even care if a girl kept all her kings in the back row or not and the reason he didnt care was because he was a goddam stupid moron
35,he hated it when you called a moron
49,all morons hate it when you call them a moron
64,shut up now holden he said with his big stupid red face
19,just shut up now

45,my chest hurt like hell from his dirty knees

65,i dont remember if he knocked me out or not but i dont think so
68,its pretty hard to knock a guy out except in the goddam movies
45,but my nose was bleeding all over the place
83,when i looked up old stradlater was standing practically right on top of me
46,he had his goddam toilet kit under his arm
48,why the hell dontcha shut up when i tellya to

40,i was so mad i was practically bawling
35,go wash your face stradlater said
115,  i told him to go wash his own moron facewhich was a pretty childish thing to say but i was mad as hell
82,i told him to stop off on the way to the can and give mrs schmidt the time
33,mrs schmidt was the janitors wife
25,she was around sixtyfive
122,i kept sitting there on the floor till i heard old stradlater close the door and go down the corridor to the can
13,then i got up
46,i couldnt find my goddam hunting hat anywhere
17,finally i found it
20,it was under the bed
167,i put it on and turned the old peak around to the back the way i liked it and then i went over and took a look at my stupid face in the mirror
36,you never saw such gore in your life
82,i had blood all over my mouth and chin and even on my pajamas and bath robe
54,it partly scared me and it partly fascinated me
54,all that blood and all sort of made me look tough
75,id only been in about two fights in my life and i lost both of them
16,im not too tough
44,im a pacifist if you want to know the truth
89,i had a feeling old ackleyd probably heard all the racket and was awake
95,so i went through the shower curtains into his room just to see what the hell he was doing
36,i hardly ever went over to his room
91,it always had a funny stink in it because he was so crumby in his personal habits
132,   a tiny bit of light came through the shower curtains and all from our room and i could see him lying in bed
35,i knew damn well he was wide awake
107,   it was pretty dark and i stepped on somebodys shoe on the floor and danm near fell on my head
57,ackley sort of sat up in bed and leaned on his arm
57,he had a lot of white stuff on his face for his pimples
39,he looked sort of spooky in the dark
30,what the hellya doing anyway
39,wuddaya mean what the hell am i doing
72,i was tryna sleep before you guys started making all that noise
40,what the hell was the fight about anyhow
18,  wheres the light
24, i couldnt find the light
37,i was sliding my hand all over the wall
27,wuddaya want the light for
24,right next to your hand
49,   i finally found the switch and turned it on
67,old ackley put his hand up so the light wouldnt hurt his eyes
31,what the hell happened to you
33, he meant all the blood and all
53,i had a little goddam tiff with stradlater i said
31,then i sat down on the floor
39,they never had any chairs in their room
56,i dont know what the hell they did with their chairs
60,listen i said do you feel like playing a little canasta
25, he was a canasta fiend
37,youre still bleeding for chrissake
33,you better put something on it
11,  itll stop
42,ya wanna play a little canasta or dontcha
24,  canasta for chrissake
44,do you know what time it is by any chance
14,  it isnt late
36,its only around eleven eleventhirty
14,   only around
12, ackley said
63,i gotta get up and go to mass in the morning for chrissake
116,you guys start hollering and fighting in the middle of the goddamwhat the hell was the fight about anyhow
18,   its a long story
29,i dont wanna bore ya ackley
39,im thinking of your welfare i told him
48,i never discussed my personal life with him
69,in the first place he was even more stupid than stradlater
46,stradlater was a goddam genius next to ackley
57,hey i said is it okay if i sleep in elys bed tonight
47,he wont be back till tomorrow night will he
29, i knew damn well he wouldnt
41,ely went home damn near every week end
58,i dont know when the hell hes coming back ackley said
24,boy did that annoy me
62,what the hell do you mean you dont know when hes coming back
49,he never comes back till sunday night does he
104,  no but for chrissake i cant just tell somebody they can sleep in his goddam bed if they want to
17,  that killed me
92,i reached up from where i was sitting on the floor and patted him on the goddam shoulder
34,youre a prince ackley kid i said
13,you know that
84, no i mean iti cant just tell somebody they can sleep in   youre a real prince
43,youre a gentleman and a scholar kid i said
15,he really was too
80,do you happen to have any cigarettes by any chancesay no or ill drop dead
30,  no i dont as a matter of fact
42,listen what the hell was the fight about
18,  i didnt answer him
65,all i did was i got up and went over and looked out the window
34,i felt so lonesome all of a sudden
29,i almost wished i was dead
44,what the hell was the fight about anyhow
40, ackley said for about the fiftieth time
35,he certainly was a bore about that
16,about you i said
22,about me for chrissake
34,i was defending your goddam honor
43,stradlater said you had a lousy personality
45,i couldnt let him get away with that stuff
20, that got him excited
80,   i told him i was only kidding and then i went over and laid down on elys bed
21,boy did i feel rotten
23,i felt so damn lonesome
24,this room stinks i said
43,i can smell your socks from way over here
40,dontcha ever send them to the laundry
62,  if you dont like it you know what you can do ackley said
16,what a witty guy
39,how bout turning off the goddam light
38,  i didnt turn it off right away though
67,i just kept laying there on elys bed thinking about jane and all
108,it just drove me stark staring mad when i thought about her whatre ya gonna dosleep in elys bed
11, ackley said
98,he was the perfect host and stradlater parked somewhere in that fatassed ed bankys car
63,every time i thought about it i felt like jumping out the window
38,the thing is you didnt know stradlater
160,most guys at pencey just talked about having sexual intercourse with girls all the timelike ackley for instancebut old stradlater really did it
80,i was personally acquainted with at least two girls he gave the time to
15,thats the truth
65,tell me the story of your fascinating life ackley kid i said
39,how bout turning off the goddam light
42,i gotta get up for mass in the morning
54,   i got up and turned it off if it made him happy
36,then i laid down on elys bed again
18,dont worry about it
27,   im not worried about it
89,only id hate like hell if ely came in all of a sudden and found some guy  relax
21,im not gonna sleep here
39,i wouldnt abuse your goddam hospitality
53,  a couple of minutes later he was snoring like mad
142,i kept laying there in the dark anyway though trying not to think about old jane and stradlater in that goddam ed bankys car
29,but it was almost impossible
56,the trouble was i knew that guy stradlaters technique
26,that made it even worse
127,we once doubledated in ed bankys car and stradlater was in the back with his date and i was in the front with mine
30,what a technique that guy had
167,what hed do was hed start snowing his date in this very quiet sincere voicelike as if he wasnt only a very handsome guy but a nice sincere guy too
39,i damn near puked listening to him
31,his date kept saying noplease
12,please dont
162, but old stradlater kept snowing her in this abraham lincoln sincere voice and finally thered be this terrific silence in the back of the car
29,it was really embarrassing
70,i dont think he gave that girl the time that nightbut damn near
123,while i was laying there trying not to think i heard old stradlater come back from the can and go in our room
96,you could hear him putting away his crumby toilet articles and all and opening the window
21,he was a freshair fiend
52,then a little while later he turned off the light
47,he didnt even look around to see where i was at
42,it was even depressing out in the street
40,you couldnt even hear any cars any more
79,i got feeling so lonesome and rotten i even felt like waking ackley up
108,hey ackley i said in sort of a whisper so stradlater couldnt hear me through the shower curtain
29,ackley didnt hear me though
25,   he still didnt hear me
20,he slept like a rock
27,  he heard that all right
37,what the hells the matter with you
27,i was asleep for chrissake
44,whats the routine on joining a monastery
12, i asked him
51,i was sort of toying with the idea of joining one
40,do you have to be a catholic and all
38,  certainly you have to be a catholic
77,you bastard did you wake me just to ask me a dumb ques  aah go back to sleep
28,im not gonna join one anyway
95,the kind of luck i have id probably join one with all the wrong kind of monks in it
21,all stupid bastards
16,or just bastards
60,  when i said that old ackley sat way the hell up in bed
163,listen he said i dont care what you say about me or anything but if you start making cracks about my goddam religion for chrissake  relax i said
57,nobodys making any cracks about your goddam religion
52, i got up off elys bed and started towards the door
68,i didnt want to hang around in that stupid atmosphere any more
94,i stopped on the way though and picked up ackleys hand and gave him a big phony handshake
28,he pulled it away from me
13,whats the idea
75,i just want to thank you for being such a goddam prince thats all i said
38,i said it in this very sincere voice
27,youre aces ackley kid i said
13,you know that
77,someday somebodys gonna bash your  i didnt even bother to listen to him
55,i shut the damn door and went out in the  corridor
122,everybody was asleep or out or home for the week end and it was very very quiet and depressing in the corridor
200,there was this empty box of kolynos toothpaste outside leahy and hoffmans door and while i walked down towards the stairs i kept giving it a boot with this sheeplined slipper i had on
98,what i thought id do i thought i might go down and see what old mal brossard was doing
44,but all of a sudden i changed my mind
115,all of a sudden i decided what id really do id get the hell out of penceyright that same night and all
50,i mean not wait till wednesday or anything
46,i just didnt want to hang around any more
34,it made me too sad and lonesome
151,so what i decided to do i decided id take a room in a hotel in new yorksome very inexpensive hotel and alland just take it easy till wednesday
64,then on wednesday id go home all rested up and feeling swell
146,i figured my parents probably wouldnt get old thurmers letter saying id been given the ax till maybe tuesday or wednesday
89,i didnt want to go home or anything till they got it and thoroughly digested it and all
51,i didnt want to be around when they first got it
30,my mother gets very hysterical
73,shes not too bad after she gets something thoroughly digested though
41,besides i sort of needed a little vacation
20,my nerves were shot
16,they really were
33,anyway thats what i decided id do
79,so i went back to the room and turned on the light to start packing and all
45,i already had quite a few things packed
33,old stradlater didnt even wake up
93,i lit a cigarette and got all dressed and then i packed these two gladstones i have
36,it only took me about two minutes
21,im a very rapid packer
52,one thing about packing depressed me a little
108,i had to pack these brandnew ice skates my mother had practically just sent me a couple of days before
17,that depressed me
130,i could see my mother going in spauldings and asking the salesman a million dopy questionsand here i was getting the ax again
29,it made me feel pretty sad
116,she bought me the wrong kind of skatesi wanted racing skates and she bought hockeybut it made me sad anyway
79,almost every time somebody gives me a present it ends up making me sad
54,after i got all packed i sort of counted my dough
66,i dont remember exactly how much i had but i was pretty loaded
65,my grandmotherd just sent me a wad about a week before
60,i have this grandmother thats quite lavish with her dough
142,she doesnt have all her marbles any moreshes old as helland she keeps sending me money for my birthday about four times a year
99,anyway even though i was pretty loaded i figured i could always use a few extra bucks
14,you never know
115,so what i did was i went down the hail and woke up frederick woodruff this guy id lent my typewriter to
42,i asked him how much hed give me for it
29,he was a pretty wealthy guy
23,he said he didnt know
38,he said he didnt much want to buy it
27,finally he bought it though
66,it cost about ninety bucks and all he bought it for was twenty
36,he was sore because id woke him up
152,when i was all set to go when i had my bags and all i stood for a while next to the stairs and took a last look down the goddam corridor
20,i was sort of crying
15,i dont know why
168,i put my red hunting hat on and turned the peak around to the back the way i liked it and then i yelled at the top of my goddam voice sleep tight ya morons
57, ill bet i woke up every bastard on the whole floor
24,then i got the hell out
106,some stupid guy had thrown peanut shells all over the stairs and i damn near broke my crazy neck
99,   it was too late to call up for a cab or anything so i walked the whole way to the station
148,it wasnt too far but it was cold as hell and the snow made it hard for walking and my gladstones kept banging hell out of my legs
44,i sort of enjoyed the air and all though
124,the only trouble was the cold made my nose hurt and right under my upper lip where old stradlaterd laid one on me
62,hed smacked my lip right on my teeth and it was pretty sore
31,my ears were nice and warm though
88,that hat i bought had earlaps in it and i put them oni didnt give a damn how i looked
25,nobody was around anyway
26,everybody was in the sack
105,i was quite lucky when i got to the station because i only had to wait about ten minutes for a train
73,while i waited i got some snow in my hand and washed my face with it
38,i still had quite a bit of blood on
206,usually i like riding on trains especially at night with the lights on and the windows so black and one of those guys coming up the aisle selling coffee and sandwiches and magazines
59,i usually buy a ham sandwich and about four magazines
123,if im on a train at night i can usually even read one of those dumb stories in a magazine without puking
198,one of those stories with a lot of phony leanjawed guys named david in it and a lot of phony girls named linda or marcia that are always lighting all the goddam davids pipes for them
85,i can even read one of those lousy stories on a train at night usually
32,but this time it was different
24,i just didnt feel like it
47,i just sort of sat and not did anything
68,all i did was take off my hunting hat and put it in my pocket
74,all of a sudden this lady got on at trenton and sat down next to me
233,practically the whole car was empty because it was pretty late and all but she sat down next to me instead of an empty seat because she had this big bag with her and i was sitting in the front seat
111,she stuck the bag right out in the middle of the aisle where the conductor and everybody could trip over it
74,she had these orchids on like shed just been to a big party or something
81,she was around forty or fortyfive i guess but she was very good looking
13,women kill me
15,they really do
73,i dont mean im oversexed or anything like thatalthough i am quite sexy
24,i just like them i mean
82,theyre always leaving their goddam bags out in the middle of the aisle
125,anyway we were sitting there and all of a sudden she said to me excuse me but isnt that a pencey prep sticker
52, she was looking up at my suitcases up on the rack
15,yes it is i said
14,she was right
61,i did have a goddam pencey sticker on one of my gladstones
20,very corny ill admit
24,oh do you go to pencey
22,she had a nice voice
28,a nice telephone voice mostly
61,she shouldve carried a goddam telephone around with her
15,yes i do i said
13,oh how lovely
46,perhaps you know my son then ernest morrow
18,he goes to pencey
15,hes in my class
124,   her son was doubtless the biggest bastard that ever went to pencey in the whole crumby history of the school
119,he was always going down the corridor after hed had a shower snapping his soggy old wet towel at peoples asses
39,thats exactly the kind of a guy he was
11,oh how nice
15, the lady said
14,but not corny
25,she was just nice and all
37,i must tell ernest we met she said
24,may i ask your name dear
30,  rudolf schmidt i told her
51,i didnt feel like giving her my whole life history
60,rudolf schmidt was the name of the janitor of our dorm
18,do you like pencey
14, she asked me
14,its not too bad
65,its not paradise or anything but its as good as most schools
49,some of the faculty are pretty conscientious
26,   ernest just adores it
23,  i know he does i said
58,then i started shooting the old crap around a little bit
39,he adapts himself very well to things
13,he really does
48,i mean he really knows how to adapt himself
18,  do you think so
14, she asked me
30,she sounded interested as hell
11,sure i said
39,then i watched her take off her gloves
32,boy was she lousy with rocks
58,i just broke a nail getting out of a cab she said
37,she looked up at me and sort of smiled
36,she had a terrifically nice smile
13,she really did
58,most people have hardly any smile at all or a lousy one
61,ernests father and i sometimes worry about him she said
50,we sometimes feel hes not a terribly good mixer
19,  how do you mean
26,hes a very sensitive boy
62,hes really never been a terribly good mixer with other boys
80,perhaps he takes things a little more seriously than he should at his age
12,  sensitive
14,that killed me
66,that guy morrow was about as sensitive as a goddam toilet seat
24,i gave her a good look
37,she didnt look like any dope to me
97,she looked like she might have a pretty damn good idea what a bastard she was the mother of
53,but you cant always tellwith somebodys mother i mean
32,mothers are all slightly insane
49,the thing is though i liked old morrows mother
16,she was all right
34,would you care for a cigarette
12, i asked her
22,she looked all around
49,i dont believe this is a smoker rudolf she said
15,that killed me
15,thats all right
57,we can smoke till they start screaming at us i said
51,she took a cigarette off me and i gave her a light
23,she looked nice smoking
95,she inhaled and all but she didnt wolf the smoke down the way most women around her age do
23,she had a lot of charm
70,she had  quite a lot of sex appeal too if you really want to know
33,she was looking at me sort of funny
83,i may be wrong but i believe your nose is bleeding dear she said all of a sudden
43,i nodded and took out my handkerchief
34,i got hit with a snowball i said
27,one of those very icy ones
92, i probably wouldve told her what really happened but it wouldve taken too long
17,i liked her though
83,i was beginning to feel sort of sorry id told her my name was rudolf schmidt
16,old ernie i said
43,hes one of the most popular boys at pencey
19,did you know that
13,  no i didnt
66,it really took everybody quite a long time to get to know him
15,hes a funny guy
45,a strange guy in lots of waysknow what i mean
25,like when i first met him
68,when i first met him i thought he was kind of a snobbish person
20,thats what i thought
11,but he isnt
98,hes just got this very original personality that takes you a little while to get to know him
71,  old mrs morrow didnt say anything but boy you shouldve seen her
30,i had her glued to her seat
92,you take somebodys mother all they want to hear about is what a hotshot their son is
54,then i really started chucking the old crap around
36,did he tell you about the elections
12, i asked her
16,the class elections
22,  she shook her head
25,i had her in a trance like
12,i really did
67,well a bunch of us wanted old ernie to be president of the class
36,i mean he was the unanimous choice
99,i mean he was the only boy that could really handle the job i saidboy was i chucking it
45,but this other boyharry fencerwas elected
114,and the reason he was elected the simple and obvious reason was because ernie wouldnt let us nominate him
46,because hes so darn shy and modest and all
19,boy hes really shy
42,you oughta make him try to get over that
16, i looked at her
27,didnt he tell you about it
12,  no he didnt
10,thats ernie
49,thats the one fault with himhes too shy and modest
57,you really oughta get him to try to relax occasionally
138,  right that minute the conductor came around for old mrs morrows ticket and it gave me a chance to quit shooting it
38,im glad i shot it for a while though
186,you take a guy like morrow thats always snapping their towel at peoples assesreally trying to hurt somebody with itthey dont just stay a rat while theyre a kid
32,they stay a rat their whole life
170,but ill bet after all the crap i shot mrs morrowll keep thinking of him now as this very shy modest guy that wouldnt let us nominate him for president
12,you cant tell
44,mothers arent too sharp about that stuff
29,would you care for a cocktail
11, i asked her
44,i was feeling in the mood for one myself
29,we can go in the club car
46,  dear are you allowed to order drinks
13, she asked me
18,not snotty though
46,she was too charming and all to be snotty
84,well no not exactly but i can usually get them on account of my heighth i said
36,and i have quite a bit of gray hair
49, i turned sideways and showed her my gray hair
29,it fascinated hell out of her
28,cmon join me why dont you
24,idve enjoyed having her
31,i really dont think id better
39,thank you so much though dear she said
42,anyway the club cars most likely closed
24,its quite late you know
15, she was right
41,id forgotten all about what time it was
82,then she looked at me and asked me what i was afraid she was going to ask me
117,ernest wrote that hed be home on wednesday that christmas vacation would start on wednesday she said
76,i hope you werent called home suddenly because of illness in the family
37, she really looked worried about it
43,she wasnt just being nosy you could tell
35,no everybodys fine at home i said
31,i have to have this operation
21,im so sorry she said
18,she really was too
53,i was right away sorry id said it but it was too late
20,it isnt very serious
48,i have this tiny little tumor on the brain
44, she put her hand up to her mouth and all
33,oh ill be all right and everything
29,its right near the outside
24,and its a very tiny one
43,they can take it out in about two minutes
63,  then i started reading this timetable i had in my pocket
20,just to stop lying
62,once i get started i can go on for hours if i feel like it
40,we didnt talk too much after that
96,she started reading this vogue she had with her and i looked out the window for a while
19,she got off at newark
58,she wished me a lot of luck with the operation and all
26,she kept calling me rudolf
84,then she invited me to visit ernie during the summer at gloucester massachusetts
186,she said their house was right on the beach and they had a tennis court and all but i just thanked her and told her i was going to south america with my grandmother
164,which was really a hot one because my grandmother hardly ever even goes out of the house except maybe to go to a goddam matinee or something
112,but i wouldnt visit that sonuvabitch morrow for all the dough in the world even if i was desperate
91,   the first thing i did when i got off at penn station i went into this phone booth
35,i felt like giving somebody a buzz
141,i left my bags right outside the booth so that i could watch them but as soon as i was inside i couldnt think of anybody to call up
13,my brother db
14,was in hollywood
78,my kid sister phoebe goes to bed around nine oclockso i couldnt call her up
127,she wouldntve cared if id woke her up but the trouble was she wouldntve been the one that answered the phone
30,my parents would be the ones
16,so that was out
140,then i thought of giving jane gallaghers mother a buzz and find out when janes vacation started but i didnt feel like it
36,besides it was pretty late to call up
350,then i thought of calling this girl i used to go around with quite frequently sally hayes because i knew her christmas vacation had started alreadyshed written me this long phony letter inviting me over to help her trim the christmas tree christmas eve and allbut i was afraid her motherd answer the phone
138,her mother knew my mother and i could picture her breaking a goddam leg to get to the phone and tell my mother i was in new york
72,besides i wasnt crazy about talking to old mrs hayes on the phone
33,she once told sally i was wild
60,she said i was wild and that i had no direction in life
131,then i thought of calling up this guy that went to the whooton school when i was there carl luce but i didnt like him much
35,so i ended up not calling anybody
154,i came out of the booth after about twenty minutes or so and got my bags and walked over to that tunnel where the cabs are and got a cab
256,im so damn absentminded i gave the driver my regular address just out of habit and alli mean i completely forgot i was going to shack up in a hotel for a couple of days and not go home till vacation started
57,i didnt think of it till we were halfway through the park
70,then i said hey do you mind turning around when you get a chance
27,i gave you the wrong address
26,i want to go back downtown
36,  the driver was sort of a wise guy
29,i cant turn around here mac
20,this heres a oneway
55,ill have to go all the way to ninedieth street now
37,  i didnt want to start an argument
10,okay i said
43,then i thought of something all of a sudden
17,hey listen i said
72,you know those ducks in that lagoon right near central park south
15,that little lake
97,by any chance do you happen to know where they go the ducks when it gets all frozen over
38,do you happen to know by any chance
52, i realized it was only one chance in a million
56,he turned around and looked at me like i was a madman
21,whatre ya tryna do bud
38,  noi was just interested thats all
51,  he didnt say anything more so i didnt either
51,until we came out of the park at ninetieth street
31,then he said all right buddy
131,  well the thing is i dont want to stay at any hotels on the east side where i might run into some acquaintances of mine
30,im traveling incognito i said
52,i hate saying corny things like traveling incognito
67, but when im with somebody thats corny i always act corny too
84,do you happen to know whose bands at the taft or the new yorker by any chance
12, no idear mac
42,   welltake me to the edmont then i said
63,would you care to stop on the way and join me for a cocktail
15,  cant do it mac
34, he certainly was good company
21,terrific personality
48,we got to the edmont hotel and i checked in
126,id put on my red hunting cap when i was in the cab just for the hell of it but i took it off before i checked in
52,i didnt want to look like a screwball or something
20,which is really ironic
77,i didnt know then that the goddam hotel was full of perverts and morons
33,screwballs all over the place
128,they gave me this very crumby room with nothing to look out of the window at except the other side of the hotel
17,i didnt care much
68,i was too depressed to care whether i had a good view or not
81,the bellboy that showed me to the room was this very old guy around sixtyfive
52,he was even more depressing than the room was
117,he was one of those bald guys that comb all their hair over from the side to cover up the baldness
33,id rather be bald than do that
63,anyway what a gorgeous job for a guy around sixtyfive years old
57,carrying peoples suitcases and waiting around for a tip
79,i suppose he wasnt too intelligent or anything but it was terrible anyway
79,after he left i looked out the window for a while with my coat on and all
32,i didnt have anything else to do
73,youd be surprised what was going on on the other side of the hotel
52,they didnt even bother to pull their shades down
148,i saw one guy a grayhaired very distinguishedlooking guy with only his shorts on do something you wouldnt believe me if i told you
38,first he put his suitcase on the bed
61,then he took out all these womens clothes and put them on
128,real womens clothessilk stockings highheeled shoes brassiere and one of those corsets with the straps hanging down and all
54,then he put on this very tight black evening dress
12,i swear to god
175,then he started walking up and down the room taking these very small steps the way a woman does and smoking a cigarette and looking at himself in the mirror
21,he was all alone too
62,unless somebody was in the bathroomi couldnt see that much
124,then in the window almost right over his i saw a man and a woman squirting water out of their mouths at each other
90,it probably was highballs not water but i couldnt see what they had in their glasses
122,anyway first hed take a swallow and squirt it all over her then she did it to himthey took turns for gods sake
21,you shouldve seen them
94,they were in hysterics the whole time like it was the funniest thing that ever happened
50,im not kidding the hotel was lousy with perverts
94,i was probably the only normal bastard in the whole placeand that isnt saying much
107,i damn near sent a telegram to old stradlater telling him to take the first train to new york
37,hed have been the king of the hotel
108,the trouble was that kind of junk is sort of fascinating to watch even if you dont want it to be
103,for instance that girl that was getting water squirted all over her face she was pretty goodlooking
26,i mean thats my big trouble
62,in my mind im probably the biggest sex maniac you ever saw
104,sometimes i can think of very crumby stuff i wouldnt mind doing if the opportunity came up
200,i can even see how it might be quite a lot of fun in a crumby way and if you were both sort of drunk and all to get a girl and squirt water or something all over each others face
45,the thing is though i dont like the idea
32,it stinks if you analyze it
289,i think if you dont really like a girl you shouldnt horse around with her at all and if you do like her then youre supposed to like her face and if you like her face you ought to be careful about doing crumby stuff to it like squirting water all over it
79,its really too bad that so much crumby stuff is a lot of fun sometimes
149,girls arent too much help either when you start trying not to get too crumby when you start trying not to spoil anything really good
81,i knew this one girl a couple of years ago that was even crumbier than i was
19,boy was she crumby
58,we had a lot of fun though for a while in a crumby way
53,sex is something i really dont understand too hot
39,you never know where the hell you are
85,i keep making up these sex rules for myself and then i break them right away
126,last year i made a rule that i was going to quit horsing around with girls that deep down gave me a pain in the ass
86,i broke it though the same week i made itthe same night as a matter of fact
88,i spent the whole night necking with a terrible phony named anne louise sherman
41,sex is something i just dont understand
23,i swear to god i dont
249,i started toying with the idea while i kept standing there of giving old jane a buzzi mean calling her long distance at bm where she went instead of calling up her mother to find out when she was coming home
95,you werent supposed to call students up late at night but i had it all figured out
72,i was going to tell whoever answered the phone that i was her uncle
116,i was going to say her aunt had just got killed in a car accident and i had to speak to her immediately
20,it wouldve worked too
63,the only reason i didnt do it was because i wasnt in the mood
66,if youre not in the mood you cant do that stuff right
76,after a while i sat down in a chair and smoked a couple of cigarettes
27,i was feeling pretty horny
19,i have to admit it
36,then all of a sudden i got this idea
128,i took out my wallet and started looking for this address a guy i met at a party last summer that went to princeton gave me
19,finally i found it
70,it was all a funny color from my wallet but you could still read it
159,it was the address of this girl that wasnt exactly a whore or anything but that didnt mind doing it once in a while this princeton guy told me
101,he brought her to a dance at princeton once and they nearly kicked him out for bringing her
49,she used to be a burlesque stripper or something
54,anyway i went over to the phone and gave her a buzz
105,her name was faith cavendish and she lived at the stanford arms hotel on sixtyfifth and broadway
15,a dump no doubt
55,for a while i didn t think she was home or something
21,nobody kept answering
42,then finally somebody picked up the phone
80,i made my voice quite deep so that she wouldnt suspect my age or anything
34,i have a pretty deep voice anyway
27,hello this womans voice said
27,none too friendly either
29,is this miss faith cavendish
11,  whos this
45,whos calling me up at this crazy goddam hour
39,   that sort of scared me a little bit
80,well i know its quite late i said in this very mature voice and all
74,i hope youll forgive me but i was very anxious to get in touch with you
26, i said it suave as hell
12,i really did
11,who is this
64,well you dont know me but im a friend of eddie birdsells
97,he suggested that if i were in town sometime we ought to get together for a cocktail or two
22,youre a friend of who
45, boy she was a real tigress over the phone
34,she was damn near yelling at me
15,edmund birdsell
21,eddie birdsell i said
50,i couldnt remember if his name was edmund or edward
43,i only met him once at a goddam stupid party
40,i dont know anybody by that name jack
71,and if you think i enjoy bein woke up in the middle eddie birdsell
14,from princeton
72,you could tell she was running the name over in her mind and all
17,birdsell birdsell
15,from princeton 
19,princeton college
22,   thats right i said
26,you from princeton college
19,  well approximately
13,how is eddie
66,this is certainly a peculiar time to call a person up though
12,jesus christ
30,he asked to be remembered to you
16,   well thank you
31,remember me to him she said
18,hes a grand person
19,whats he doing now
54, she was getting friendly as hell all of a sudden
10,oh you know
19,same old stuff i said
41,how the hell did i know what he was doing
21,i hardly knew the guy
50,i didnt even know if he was still at princeton
11,look i said
65,would you be interested in meeting me for a cocktail somewhere
56,  by any chance do you have any idea what time it is
34,whats your name anyhow may i ask
52, she was getting an english accent all of a sudden
35,you sound a little on the young side
11,  i laughed
57,thank you for the compliment i said suave as hell
29,holden caulfields my name
61, i shouldve given her a phony name but i didnt think of it
19,well look mr cawffle
75,im not in the habit of making engagements in the middle of the night
17,im a working gal
27, tomorrows sunday i told her
10,well anyway
27,i gotta get my beauty sleep
19,you know how it is
59,   i thought we might have just one cocktail together
15,it isnt too late
24,youre very sweet she said
22,where ya callin from
24,where ya at now anyways
18,im in a phone booth
12,  oh she said
37,then there was this very long pause
69,well id like awfully to get together with you sometime mr cawffle
27,you sound very attractive
43,you sound like a very attractive person
13,but it is late
31,  i could come up to your place
29,  well ordinary id say grand
159,i mean id love to have you drop up for a cocktail but my roommate happens to be ill shes been laying here all night without a wink of sleep
43,she just this minute closed her eyes and all
12,thats too bad
23,  where ya stopping at
54,perhaps we could get together for cocktails tomorrow
37,   i cant make it tomorrow i said
39,tonights the only time i can make it
19, what a dope i was
23,i shouldntve said that
22,well im awfully sorry
37,  ill say hello to eddie for you
15,  willya do that
40,i hope you enjoy your stay in new york
18,its a grand place
13,   i know it is
19,good night i said
14,then i hung up
28,boy i really fouled that up
58,i shouldve at least made it for cocktails or something
29,   it was still pretty early
55,im not sure what time it was but it wasnt too late
65,the one thing i hate to do is go to bed when im not even tired
131,so i opened my suitcases and took out a clean shirt and then i went in the bathroom and washed and changed my shirt
120,what i thought id do i thought id go downstairs and see what the hell was going on in the lavender room
63,they had this night club the lavender room in the hotel
95,while i was changing my shirt i damn near gave my kid sister phoebe a buzz though
52,i certainly felt like talking to her on the phone
26,somebody with sense and all
161,but i couldnt take a chance on giving her a buzz because she was only a little kid and she wouldnt have been up let alone anywhere near the phone
92,i thought of maybe hanging up if my parents answered but that wouldntve worked either
20,theyd know it was me
32,my mother always knows its me
12,shes psychic
93,but i certainly wouldnt have minded shooting the crap with old phoebe for a while
19,you should see her
69,you never saw a little kid so pretty and smart in your whole life
18,shes really smart
59,i mean shes had all as ever since she started school
63,as a matter of fact im the only dumb one in the family
14,my brother db
105,s a writer and all and my brother allie the one that died that i told you about was a wizard
32,im the only really dumb one
29,but you ought to see old phoebe
105,she has this sort of red hair a little bit like allies was thats very short in the summertime
48,in the summertime she sticks it behind her ears
33,she has nice pretty little ears
40,in the wintertime its pretty long though
61,sometimes my mother braids it and sometimes she doesnt
21,its really nice though
12,shes only ten
41,shes quite skinny like me but nice skinny
18,rollerskate skinny
153,i watched her once from the window when she was crossing over fifth avenue to go to the park and thats what she is rollerskate skinny
14,youd like her
102,i mean if you tell old phoebe something she knows exactly what the hell youre talking about
47,i mean you can even take her anywhere with you
80,if you take her to a lousy movie for instance she knows its a lousy movie
80,if you take her to a pretty good movie she knows its a pretty good movie
81,and i took her to see this french movie the bakers wife with raimu in it
14,it killed her
61,her favorite is the  steps though with robert donat
100,she knows the whole goddam movie by heart because ive taken her to see it about ten times
259,when old donat comes up to this scotch farmhouse for instance when hes running away from the cops and all phoebell say right out loud in the movieright when the scotch guy in the picture says itcan you eat the herring
30, she knows all the talk by heart
306,and when this professor in the picture thats really a german spy sticks up his little finger with part of the middle joint missing to show robert donat old phoebe beats him to itshe holds up her little finger at me in the dark right in front of my face
13,shes all right
12,youd like her
65,the only trouble is shes a little too affectionate sometimes
33,shes very emotional for a child
14,she really is
59,something else she does she writes books all the time
28,only she doesnt finish them
88,theyre all about some kid named hazel weatherfieldonly old phoebe spells it hazle
47, old hazle weatherfield is a girl detective
71,shes supposed to be an orphan but her old man keeps showing up
70,her old mans always a tall attractive gentleman about  years of age
13, that kills me
31,i swear to god youd like her
57,she was smart even when she was a very tiny little kid
116,when she was a very tiny little kid i and allie used to take her to the park with us especially on sundays
123,allie had this sailboat he used to like to fool around with on sundays and we used to take old phoebe with us
72,shed wear white gloves and walk right between us like a lady and all
110,and when allie and i were having some conversation about things in general old phoebed be listening
100,sometimes youd forget she was around because she was such a little kid but shed let you know
32,shed interrupt you all the time
59,shed give allie or i a push or something and say who
13,who said that
17,bobby or the lady
89, and wed tell her who said it and shed say oh and go right on listening and all
22,she killed allie too
23,i mean he liked her too
127,shes ten now and not such a tiny little kid any more but she still kills everybodyeverybody with any sense anyway
74,anyway she was somebody you always felt like talking to on the phone
139,but i was too afraid my parents would answer and then theyd find out i was in new york and kicked out of pencey and all
43,so i just finished putting on my shirt
100,then i got all ready and went down in the elevator to the lobby to see what was going on
105,except for a few pimpylooking guys and a few whorylooking blondes the lobby was pretty empty
84,but you could hear the band playing in the lavender room and so i went in there
80,it wasnt very crowded but they gave me a lousy table anywayway in the back
54,i shouldve waved a buck under the headwaiters nose
52,in new york boy money really talksim not kidding
21,the band was putrid
12,buddy singer
47,very brassy but not good brassycorny brassy
62,also there were very few people around my age in the place
35,in fact nobody was around my age
64,they were mostly old showoffylooking guys with their dates
39,except at the table right next to me
89,at the table right next to me there were these three girls around thirty or so
189,the whole three of them were pretty ugly and they all had on the kind of hats that you knew they didnt really live in new york but one of them the blonde one wasnt too bad
140,she was sort of cute the blonde one and i started giving her the old eye a little bit but just then the waiter came up for my order
201,i ordered a scotch and soda and told him not to mix iti said it fast as hell because if you hem and haw they think youre under twentyone and wont sell you any intoxicating liquor
37,i had trouble with him anyway though
70,im sorry sir he said but do you have some verification of your age
29,your drivers license perhaps
130,  i gave him this very cold stare like hed insulted the hell out of me and asked him do i look like im under twentyone
53,  im sorry sir but we have our  okay okay i said
27,i figured the hell with it
16,bring me a coke
47, he started to go away but i called him back
51,cantcha stick a little rum in it or something
11, i asked him
31,i asked him very nicely and all
50,i cant sit in a corny place like this cold sober
47,cantcha stick a little rum in it or something
19,  im very sorry sir
28, he said and beat it on me
34,i didnt hold it against him though
63,they lose their jobs if they get caught selling to a minor
17,im a goddam minor
72,i started giving the three witches at the next table the eye again
23,that is the blonde one
42,the other two were strictly from hunger
29,i didnt do it crudely though
71,i just gave all three of them this very cool glance and all
91,what they did though the three of them when i did it they started giggling like morons
76,they probably thought i was too young to give anybody the onceover
84,that annoyed hell out of me youdve thought i wanted to marry them or something
114,i shouldve given them the freeze after they did that but the trouble was i really felt like dancing
71,im very fond of dancing sometimes and that was one of the times
97,so all of a sudden i sort of leaned over and said would any of you girls care to dance
39, i didnt ask them crudely or anything
21,very suave in fact
54,but god damn it they thought that was a panic too
34,they started giggling some more
45,im not kidding they were three real morons
10,cmon i said
37,ill dance with you one at a time
11,how bout it
28, i really felt like dancing
151,finally the blonde one got up to dance with me because you could tell i was really talking to her and we walked out to the dance floor
54,the other two grools nearly had hysterics when we did
71,i certainly mustve been very hard up to even bother with any of them
21,but it was worth it
27,the blonde was some dancer
52,she was one of the best dancers i ever danced with
101,im not kidding some of these very stupid girls can really knock you out on a dance floor
219,you take a really smart girl and half the time shes trying to lead you around the dance floor or else shes such a lousy dancer the best thing to do is stay at the table and just get drunk with her
45,you really can dance i told the blonde one
18,you oughta be a pro
64,i danced with a pro once and youre twice as good as she was
39,did you ever hear of marco and miranda
31,she wasnt even listening to me
40,she was looking all around the place
45,i said did you ever hear of marco and miranda
12, i dont know
11,i dont know
37,  well theyre dancers shes a dancer
23,shes not too hot though
71,she does everything shes supposed to but shes not so hot anyway
52,you know when a girls really a terrific dancer
11,  wudga say
31,she wasnt listening to me even
43,her mind was wandering all over the place
67,i said do you know when a girls really a terrific dancer
42,   wellwhere i have my hand on your back
126,if i think there isnt anything underneath my handno can no legs no feet no anythingthen the girls really a terrific dancer
30,  she wasnt listening though
30,so i ignored her for a while
14,we just danced
33,god could that dopey girl dance
122,buddy singer and his stinking band was playing just one of those things and even they couldnt ruin it entirely
14,its a swell song
194,i didnt try any trick stuff while we dancedi hate a guy that does a lot of showoff tricky stuff on the dance floorbut i was moving her around plenty and she stayed with me
119,the funny thing is i thought she was enjoying it too till all of a sudden she came out with this very dumb remark
66,i and my girl friends saw peter lorre last night she said
16,the movie actor
25,he was buyin a newspaper
23,  youre lucky i told her
20,youre really lucky
13,you know that
25, she was really a moron
19,but what a dancer
140,i could hardly stop myself from sort of giving her a kiss on the top of her dopey headyou know right where the part is and all
25,she got sore when i did it
14,whats the idea
27,you really can dance i said
58,i have a kid sister thats only in the goddam fourth grade
87,youre about as good as she is and she can dance better than anybody living or dead
42, watch your language if you dont mind
18,  what a lady boy
21,a queen for chrissake
21,where you girls from
12, i asked her
24,she didnt answer me though
73,she was busy looking around for old peter lorre to show up i guess
20,where you girls from
19, i asked her again
19,where you girls from
40,dont answer if you dont feel like it
36,i dont want you to strain yourself
26, seattle washington she said
39,she was doing me a big favor to tell me
47,youre a very good conversationalist i told her
13,you know that
15,   i let it drop
28,it was over her head anyway
74,do you feel like jitterbugging a little bit if they play a fast one
65,not corny jitterbug not jump or anythingjust nice and easy
130,everybodyll all sit down when they play a fast one except the old guys and the fat guys and well have plenty of room
31, its immaterial to me she said
27,heyhow old are you anyhow
37,   that annoyed me for some reason
22,dont spoil it i said
23,im twelve for chrissake
17,im big for my age
19,i toleja about that
41,i dont like that type language she said
96,if youre gonna use that type language i can go sit down with my girl friends you know
75,  i apologized like a madman because the band was starting a fast one
77,she started jitterbugging with me but just very nice and easy not corny
20,she was really good
36,all you had to do was touch her
81,and when she turned around her pretty little butt twitched so nice and all
20,she knocked me out
50,i was half in love with her by the time we sat down
28,thats the thing about girls
194,every time they do something pretty even if theyre not much to look at or even if theyre sort of stupid you fall half in love with them and then you never know where the hell you are
13,jesus christ
26,they can drive you crazy
15,they really can
115,they didnt invite me to sit down at their table mostly because they were too ignorantbut i sat down anyway
74,the blonde id been dancing withs name was bernice somethingcrabs or krebs
51,the two ugly ones names were marty and laverne
65,i told them my name was jim steele just for the hell of it
104,then i tried to get them in a little intelligent conversation but it was practically impossible
29,you had to twist their arms
74,you could hardly tell which was the stupidest of the three of them
163,and the whole three of them kept looking all around the goddam room like as if they expected a flock of goddam movie stars to come in any minute
154,they probably thought movie stars always hung out in the lavender room when they came to new york instead of the stork club or el morocco and all
95,anyway it took me about a half hour to find out where they all worked and all in seattle
48,they all worked in the same insurance office
114,i asked them if they liked it but do you think you could get an intelligent answer out of those three dopes
113,i thought the two ugly ones marty and laverne were sisters but they got very insulted when i asked them
136,you could tell neither one of them wanted to look like the other one and you couldnt blame them but it was very amusing anyway
66,i danced with them allthe whole three of themone at a time
92,the one ugly one laverne wasnt too bad a dancer but the other one old marty was murder
71,old marty was like dragging the statue of liberty around the floor
100,the only way i could even half enjoy myself dragging her around was if i amused myself a little
92,so i told her i just saw gary cooper the movie star on the other side of the floor
29, she asked meexcited as hell
27,   aw you just missed him
17,he just went out
37,why didnt you look when i told you
108,  she practically stopped dancing and started looking over everybodys heads to see if she could see him
46,id just about broken her heart i really had
36,i was sorry as hell id kidded her
54,some people you shouldnt kid even if they deserve it
33,heres what was very funny though
109,when we got back to the table old marty told the other two that gary cooper had just gone out
78,boy old laverne and bernice nearly committed suicide when they heard that
68,they got all excited and asked marty if shed seen him and all
56,old mart said shed only caught a glimpse of him
14,that killed me
153,the bar was closing up for the night so i bought them all two drinks apiece quick before it closed and i ordered two more cokes for myself
41,the goddam table was lousy with glasses
79,the one ugly one laverne kept kidding me because i was only drinking cokes
34,she had a sterling sense of humor
95,she and old marty were drinking tom collinsesin the middle of december for gods sake
30,they didnt know any better
65,the blonde one old bernice was drinking bourbon and water
36,she was really putting it away too
73,the whole three of them kept looking for movie stars the whole time
36,they hardly talkedeven to each other
42,old marty talked more than the other two
254,she kept saying these very corny boring things like calling the can the little girls room and she thought buddy singers poor old beatup clarinet player was really terrific when he stood up and took a couple of icecold hot licks
40,she called his clarinet a licorice stick
15, was she corny
65,the other ugly one laverne thought she was a very witty type
82,she kept asking me to call up my father and ask him what he was doing tonight
53,she kept asking me if my father had a date or not
54,four times she asked me thatshe was certainly witty
64,old bernice the blonde one didnt say hardly anything at all
48,every time id ask her something she said what
45, that can get on your nerves after a while
114,all of a sudden when they finished their drink all three of them stood up on me and said they had to get to bed
102,they said they were going to get up early to see the first show at radio city music hall
70,i tried to get them to stick around for a while but they wouldnt
24,so we said goodby and all
104,i told them id look them up in seattle sometime if i ever got there but i doubt if i ever will
18,look them up i mean
67,with cigarettes and all the check came to about thirteen bucks
180,i think they shouldve at least offered to pay for the drinks they had before i joined themi wouldntve let them naturally but they shouldve at least offered
24,i didnt care much though
72,they were so ignorant and they had those sad fancy hats on and all
108,and that business about getting up early to see the first show at radio city music hall depressed me
294,if somebody some girl in an awfullooking hat for instance comes all the way to new yorkfrom seattle washington for gods sakeand ends up getting up early in the morning to see the goddam first show at radio city music hall it makes me so depressed i cant stand it
97,idve bought the whole three of them a hundred drinks if only they hadnt told me that
53,i left the lavender room pretty soon after they did
72,they were closing it up anyway and the band had quit a long time ago
222,in the first place it was one of those places that are very terrible to be in unless you have somebody good to dance with or unless the waiter lets you buy real drinks instead of just cokes
137,there isnt any night club in the world you can sit in for a long time unless you can at least buy some liquor and get drunk
61,or unless youre with some girl that really knocks you out
108,  all of a sudden on my way out to the lobby i got old jane gallagher on the brain  again
41,i got her on and i couldnt get her off
291,i sat down in this vomitylooking chair in the lobby and thought about her and stradlater sitting in that goddam ed bankys car and though i was pretty damn sure old stradlater hadnt given her the timei know old jane like a booki still couldnt get her off my brain
24,i knew her like a book
13,i really did
226,i mean besides checkers she was quite fond of all athletic sports and after i got to know her the whole summer long we played tennis together almost every morning and golf almost every afternoon
45,i really got to know her quite intimately
103,i dont mean it was anything physical or anythingit wasntbut we saw each other all the time
64,you dont always have to get too sexy to get to know a girl
155,the way i met her this doberman pinscher she had used to come over and relieve himself on our lawn and my mother got very irritated about it
60,she called up janes mother and made a big stink about it
68,my mother can make a very big stink about that kind of stuff
148,then what happened a couple of days later i saw jane laying on her stomach next to the swimming pool at the club and i said hello to her
102,i knew she lived in the house next to ours but id never conversed with her before or anything
61,she gave me the big freeze when i said hello that day though
109,i had a helluva time convincing her that i didnt give a good goddam where her dog relieved himself
58,he could do it in the living room for all i cared
59,anyway after that jane and i got to be friends and all
41,i played golf with her that same afternoon
33,she lost eight balls i remember
104,i had a terrible time getting her to at least open her eyes when she took a swing at the ball
36,i improved her game immensely though
21,im a very good golfer
71,if i told you what i go around in you probably wouldnt believe me
82,i almost was once in a movie short but i changed my mind at the last minute
127,i figured that anybody that hates the movies as much as i do id be a phony if i let them stick me in a movie short
30,she was a funny girl old jane
58,i wouldnt exactly describe her as strictly beautiful
27,she knocked me out though
29,she was sort of mucklemouthed
136,i mean when she was talking and she got excited about something her mouth sort of went in about fifty directions her lips and all
13,that killed me
56,and she never really closed it all the way her mouth
117,it was always just a little bit open especially when she got in her golf stance or when she was reading a book
48,she was always reading and she read very good books
34,she read a lot of poetry and all
124,she was the only one outside my family that i ever showed allies baseball mitt to with all the poems written on it
154,shed never met allie or anything because that was her first summer in mainebefore that she went to cape codbut i told her quite a lot about him
44,she was interested in that kind of stuff
35,my mother didnt like her too much
128,i mean my mother always thought jane and her mother were sort of snubbing her or something when they didnt say hello
143,my mother saw them in the village a lot because jane used to drive to market with her mother in this lasalle convertible they had
42,my mother didnt think jane was pretty even
12,i did though
49,i just liked the way she looked thats all
29,i remember this one afternoon
71,it was the only time old jane and i ever got close to necking even
142,it was a saturday and it was raining like a bastard out and i was over at her house on the porchthey had this big screenedin porch
25,we were playing checkers
94,i used to kid her once in a while because she wouldnt take her kings out of the back row
34,but i didnt kid her much though
42,you never wanted to kid jane too much
127,i think i really like it best when you can kid the pants off a girl when the opportunity arises but its a funny thing
72,the girls i like best are the ones i never feel much like kidding
185,sometimes i think theyd like it if you kidded themin fact i know they wouldbut its hard to get started once youve known them a pretty long time and never kidded them
86,anyway i was telling you about that afternoon jane and i came close to necking
220,it was raining like hell and we were out on her porch and all of a sudden this booze hound her mother was married to came out on the porch and asked jane if there were any cigarettes in the house
156,i didnt know him too well or anything but he looked like the kind of guy that wouldnt talk to you much unless he wanted something off you
26,he had a lousy personality
106,anyway old jane wouldnt answer him when he asked her if she knew where there was any cigarettes
64,so the guy asked her again but she still wouldnt answer him
35,she didnt even look up from the game
40,finally the guy went inside the house
52,when he did i asked jane what the hell was going on
32,she wouldnt even answer me then
81,she made out like she was concentrating on her next move in the game and all
72,then all of a sudden this tear plopped down on the checkerboard
51,on one of the red squaresboy i can still see it
53,she just rubbed it into the board with her finger
54,i dont know why but it bothered hell out of me
171,so what i did was i went over and made her move over on the glider so that i could sit down next to heri practically sat down in her lap as a matter of fact
212,then she really started to cry and the next thing i knew i was kissing her all overanywhereher eyes her nose her forehead her eyebrows and all her earsher whole face except her mouth and all
47,she sort of wouldnt let me get to her mouth
53,anyway it was the closest we ever got to necking
151,after a while she got up and went in and put on this red and white sweater she had that knocked me out and we went to a goddam movie
113,i asked her on the way if mr cudahythat was the booze hounds namehad ever tried to get wise with her
117,she was pretty young but she had this terrific figure and i wouldntve put it past that cudahy bastard
17,she said no though
57,i never did find out what the hell was the matter
60,some girls you practically never find out whats the matter
139,i dont want you to get the idea she was a goddam icicle or something just because we never necked or horsed around much
49,i held hands with her all the time for instance
87,that doesnt sound like much i realize but she was terrific to hold hands with
206,most girls if you hold hands with them their goddam hand dies on you or else they think they have to keep moving their hand all the time as if they were afraid theyd bore you or something
17,jane was different
136,wed get into a goddam movie or something and right away wed start holding hands and we wouldnt quit till the movie was over
67,and without changing the position or making a big deal out of it
79,you never even worried with jane whether your hand was sweaty or not
35,all you knew was you were happy
15,you really were
33,one other thing i just thought of
78,one time in this movie jane did something that just about knocked me out
118,the newsreel was on or something and all of a sudden i felt this hand on the back of my neck and it was janes
28,it was a funny thing to do
317,i mean she was quite young and all and most girls if you see them putting their hand on the back of somebodys neck theyre around twentyfive or thirty and usually theyre doing it to their husband or their little kidi do it to my kid sister phoebe once in a while for instance
104,but if a girls quite young and all and she does it its so pretty it just about kills you
98,anyway thats what i was thinking about while i sat in that vomitylooking chair in the lobby
122,every time i got to the part about her out with stradlater in that damn ed bankys car it almost drove me crazy
88,i knew she wouldnt let him get to first base with her but it drove me crazy anyway
68,i dont even like to talk about it if you want to know the truth
50,there was hardly anybody in the lobby any more
137,even all the whorylooking blondes werent around any more and all of a sudden i felt like getting the hell out of the place
26,it was too depressing
30,and i wasnt tired or anything
48,so i went up to my room and put on my coat
127,i also took a look out the window to see if all the perverts were still in action but the lights and all were out now
100,i went down in the elevator again and got a cab and told the driver to take me down to ernies
67,ernies is this night club in greenwich village that my brother db
98,used to go to quite frequently before he went out to hollywood and prostituted himself
45,he used to take me with him once in a while
55,ernies a big fat colored guy that plays the piano
154,hes a terrific snob and he wont hardly even talk to you unless youre a big shot or a celebrity or something but he can really play the piano
38,hes so good hes almost corny in fact
56,i dont exactly know what i mean by that but i mean it
98,i certainly like to hear him play but sometimes you feel like turning his goddam piano over
138,i think its because sometimes when he plays he sounds like the kind of guy that wont talk to you unless youre a big shot
95,   the cab i had was a real old one that smelled like someoned just tossed his cookies in it
76,i always get those vomity kind of cabs if i go anywhere late at night
98,what made it worse it was so quiet and lonesome out even though it was saturday night
42,i didnt see hardly anybody on the street
273,now and then you just saw a man and a girl crossing a street with their arms around each others waists and all or a bunch of hoodlumylooking guys and their dates all of them laughing like hyenas at something you could bet wasnt funny
79,new yorks terrible when somebody laughs on the street very late at night
28,you can hear it for miles
48,it makes you feel so lonesome and depressed
87,i kept wishing i could go home and shoot the bull for a while with old phoebe
107,but finally after i was riding a while the cab driver and i sort of struck up a conversation
22,his name was horwitz
58,he was a much better guy than the other driver id had
60,anyway i thought maybe he might know about the ducks
19,hey horwitz i said
43,you ever pass by the lagoon in central park
27,down by central park south
11, the lagoon
29,that little lake like there
22,where the ducks are
20,  yeah what about it
50,   well you know the ducks that swim around in it
28,in the springtime and all
73,do you happen to know where they go in the wintertime by any chance
15, where who goes
11,   the ducks
25,do you know by any chance
140,i mean does somebody come around in a truck or something and take them away or do they fly away by themselvesgo south or something
57,  old horwitz turned all the way around and looked at me
37,he was a very impatienttype guy
28,he wasnt a bad guy though
22,how the hell should i know
57,how the hell should i know a stupid thing like that
39, well dont get sore about it i said
34,he was sore about it or something
11,nobodys sore
102,   i stopped having a conversation with him if he was going to get so damn touchy about it
33,but he started it up again himself
72,he turned all the way around again and said the fish dont go no place
42,they stay right where they are the fish
25,right in the goddam lake
25,the fishthats different
22,the fish is different
59,im talking about the ducks i  whats different about it
41,nothins different about it horwitz said
54,everything he said he sounded sore about something
89,its tougher for the fish the winter and all than it is for the ducks for chrissake
27,use your head for chrissake
44,  i didnt say anything for about a minute
22,then i said all right
120,what do they do the fish and all when that whole little lakes a solid block of ice people skating on it and all
33,  old horwitz turned around again
38,what the hellaya mean what do they do
17, he yelled at me
46,they stay right where they are for chrissake
33, they cant just ignore the ice
27,they cant just ignore it
21,   whos ignoring it
20,nobodys ignoring it
14, horwitz said
119,he got so damn excited and all i was afraid he was going to drive the cab right into a lamppost or something
36,they live right in the goddam ice
32,its their nature for chrissake
58,they get frozen right in one position for the whole winter
21,what do they eat then
81,i mean if theyre frozen solid they cant swim around looking for food and all
54,  their bodies for chrissakewhatsa matter with ya
106,their bodies take in nutrition and all right through the goddam seaweed and crap thats in the ice
40,they got their pores open the whole time
35,thats their nature for chrissake
14,see what i mean
54, he turned way the hell around again to look at me
13,i let it drop
68,i was afraid he was going to crack the damn taxi up or something
90,besides he was such a touchy guy it wasnt any pleasure discussing anything with him
67,would you care to stop off and have a drink with me somewhere
27,he didnt answer me though
32,i guess he was still thinking
23,i asked him again though
26,he was a pretty good guy
21,quite amusing and all
48,i aint got no time for no liquor bud he said
33,how the hell old are you anyways
26,why aintcha home in bed
12, im not tired
100,   when i got out in front of ernies and paid the fare old horwitz brought up the fish again
30,he certainly had it on his mind
14,listen he said
62,if you was a fish mother natured take care of you wouldnt she
67,you dont think them fish just die when it gets to be winter do ya
91, no but   youre goddam right they dont horwitz said and drove off like a bat out of hell
42,he was about the touchiest guy i ever met
36,everything you said made him sore
56,even though it was so late old ernies was jampacked
49,mostly with prep school jerks and college jerks
106,almost every damn school in the world gets out earlier for christmas vacation than the schools i go to
56,you could hardly check your coat it was so crowded
69,it was pretty quiet though because ernie was playing the piano
87,it was supposed to be something holy for gods sake when he sat down at the piano
17,nobodys that good
162,about three couples besides me were waiting for tables and they were all shoving and standing on tiptoes to get a look at old ernie while he played
148,he had a big damn mirror in front of the piano with this big spotlight on him so that everybody could watch his face while he played
72,you couldnt see his fingers while he playedjust his big old face
134,im not too sure what the name of the song was that he was playing when i came in but whatever it was he was really stinking it up
153,he was putting all these dumb showoffy ripples in the high notes and a lot of other very tricky stuff that gives me a pain in the ass
54,you shouldve heard the crowd though when he was finished
16,you wouldve puked
13,they went mad
111,they were exactly the same morons that laugh like hyenas in the movies at stuff that isnt funny
136,i swear to god if i were a piano player or an actor or something and all those dopes thought i was terrific id hate it
40,i wouldnt even want them to clap for me
38,people always clap for the wrong things
63,if i were a piano player id play it in the goddam closet
158,anyway when he was finished and everybody was clapping their heads off old ernie turned around on his stool and gave this very phony humble bow
87,like as if he was a helluva humble guy besides being a terrific piano player
61,it was very phonyi mean him being such a big snob and all
78,in a funny way though i felt sort of sorry for him when he was finished
69,i dont even think he knows any more when hes playing right or not
20,it isnt all his fault
112,i partly blame all those dopes that clap their heads offtheyd foul up anybody if you gave them a chance
205,anyway it made me feel depressed and lousy again and i damn near got my coat back and went back to the hotel but it was too early and i didnt feel much like being all alone
127,they finally got me this stinking table right up against a wall and behind a goddam post where you couldnt see anything
194,it was one of those tiny little tables that if the people at the next table dont get up to let you byand they never do the bastardsyou practically have to climb into your chair
88,i ordered a scotch and soda which is my favorite drink next to frozen daiquiris
155,if you were only around six years old you could get liquor at ernies the place was so dark and all and besides nobody cared how old you were
51,you could even be a dope fiend and nobodyd care
27,i was surrounded by jerks
13,im not kidding
136,at this other tiny table right to my left practically on top of me there was this funnylooking guy and this funnylooking girl
54,they were around my age or maybe just a little older
11,it was funny
86,you could see they were being careful as hell not to drink up the minimum too fast
91,i listened to their conversation for a while because i didnt have anything else to do
79,he was telling her about some pro football game hed seen that afternoon
74,he gave her every single goddam play in the whole gameim not kidding
48,he was the most boring guy i ever listened to
156,and you could tell his date wasnt even interested in the goddam game but she was even funnierlooking than he was so i guess she had to listen
31,real ugly girls have it tough
37,i feel so sorry for them sometimes
143,sometimes i cant even look at them especially if theyre with some dopey guy thats telling them all about a goddam football game
55,on my right the conversation was even worse though
135,on my right there was this very joe yalelooking guy in a gray flannel suit and one of those flittylooking tattersall vests
41,all those ivy league bastards look alike
161,my father wants me to go to yale or maybe princeton but i swear i wouldnt go to one of those ivy league colleges if i was dying for gods sake
72,anyway this joe yalelooking guy had a terrificlooking girl with him
23,boy she was goodlooking
64,but you shouldve heard the conversation they were having
53,in the first place they were both slightly crocked
214,what he was doing he was giving her a feel under the table and at the same time telling her all about some guy in his dorm that had eaten a whole bottle of aspirin and nearly committed suicide
44,his date kept saying to him how horrible 
12,dont darling
12,please dont
102, imagine giving somebody a feel and telling them about a guy committing suicide at the same time
14,they killed me
87,i certainly began to feel like a prize horses ass though sitting there all by myself
53,there wasnt anything to do except smoke and drink
102,what i did do though i told the waiter to ask old ernie if hed care to join me for a drink
33,i told him to tell him i was db
59,i dont think he ever even gave him my message though
51,those bastards never give your message to anybody
73,all of a sudden this girl came up to me and said holden caulfield
30, her name was lillian simmons
13,my brother db
38,used to go around with her for a while
24,she had very big knockers
92,i tried to get up naturally but it was some job getting up in a place like that
87,she had some navy officer with her that looked like he had a poker up his ass
25,how marvelous to see you
27, old lillian simmons said
17,strictly a phony
21,hows your big brother
39, thats all she really wanted to know
17,hes in hollywood
14,   in hollywood
13,how marvelous
15,whats he doing
11,  i dont know
14,writing i said
34,i didnt feel like discussing it
69,you could tell she thought it was a big deal his being in hollywood
22,almost everybody does
52,mostly people whove never read any of his stories
25,it drives me crazy though
33,how exciting old lillian said
41,then she introduced me to the navy guy
42,his name was commander blop or something
150,he was one of those guys that think theyre being a pansy if they dont break around forty of your fingers when they shake hands with you
25,god i hate that stuff
22,are you all alone baby
22, old lillian asked me
61,she was blocking up the whole goddam traffic in the aisle
57,you could tell she liked to block up a lot of traffic
89,this waiter was waiting for her to move out of the way but she didnt even notice him
12,it was funny
140,you could tell the waiter didnt like her much you could tell even the navy guy didnt like her much even though he was dating her
26,and i didnt like her much
51,you had to feel sort of sorry for her in a way
26,dont you have a date baby
13, she asked me
62,i was standing up now and she didnt even tell me to sit down
58,she was the type that keeps you standing up for hours
16,isnt he handsome
27, she said to the navy guy
45,holden youre getting handsomer by the minute
34, the navy guy told her to come on
54,he told her they were blocking up the whole aisle
41,holden come join us old lillian said
16,bring your drink
31,  i was just leaving i told her
26,i have to meet somebody
63, you could tell she was just trying to get in good with me
19,so that id tell old db
24,well you little soandso
16,all right for you
53,tell your big brother i hate him when you see him
16,  then she left
74,the navy guy and i told each other we were glad tove met each other
21,which always kills me
76,im always saying glad tove met you to somebody im not at all glad i met
62,if you want to stay alive you have to say that stuff though
99,after id told her i had to meet somebody i didnt have any goddam choice except to leave
82,i couldnt even stick around to hear old ernie play something halfway decent
129,but i certainly wasnt going to sit down at a table with old lillian simmons and that navy guy and be bored to death
52,it made me mad though when i was getting my coat
45,people are always ruining things for you
43,   i walked all the way back to the hotel
26,fortyone gorgeous blocks
55,i didnt do it because i felt like walking or anything
83,it was more because i didnt feel like getting in and out of another taxicab
106,sometimes you get tired of riding in taxicabs the same way you get tired riding in elevators
71,all of a sudden you have to walk no matter how far or how high up
87,when i was a kid i used to walk all the way up to our apartment very frequently
15,twelve stories
51,you wouldnt even have known it had snowed at all
47,there was hardly any snow on the sidewalks
124,but it was freezing cold and i took my red hunting hat out of my pocket and put it oni didnt give a damn how i looked
27,i even put the earlaps down
87,i wished i knew whod swiped my gloves at pencey because my hands were freezing
66,not that id have done much about it even if i had known
32,im one of these very yellow guys
31,i try not to show it but i am
128,for instance if id found out at pencey whod stolen my gloves i probably wouldve gone down to the crooks room and said okay
36,how bout handing over those gloves
111, then the crook that had stolen them probably wouldve said his voice very innocent and all what gloves
99, then what i probably wouldve done id have gone in his closet and found the gloves somewhere
58,hidden in his goddam galoshes or something for instance
106,id have taken them out and showed them to the guy and said i suppose these are your goddam gloves
140, then the crook probably wouldve given me this very phony innocent look and said i never saw those gloves before in my life
25,if theyre yours take em
29,i dont want the goddam things
71, then i probably wouldve just stood there for about five minutes
148,id have the damn gloves right in my hand and all but id feel i ought to sock the guy in the jaw or somethingbreak his goddam jaw
42,only i wouldnt have the guts to do it
43,id just stand there trying to look tough
122,what i might do i might say something very cutting and snotty to rile him upinstead of socking him in the jaw
142,anyway if i did say something very cutting and snotty hed probably get up and come over to me and say listen caulfield
27,are you calling me a crook
82, then instead of saying youre goddam right i am you dirty crooked bastard
103, all i probably wouldve said would be all i know is my goddam gloves were in your goddam galoshes
129, right away then the guy would know for sure that i wasnt going to take a sock at him and he probably wouldve said listen
24,lets get this straight
27,are you calling me a thief
66, then i probably wouldve said nobodys calling anybody a thief
57,all i know is my gloves were in your goddam galoshes
39, it could go on like that for hours
67,finally though id leave his room without even taking a sock at him
109,id probably go down to the can and sneak a cigarette and watch myself getting tough in the mirror
69,anyway thats what i thought about the whole way back to the hotel
23,its no fun to he yellow
25,maybe im not all yellow
11,i dont know
128,i think maybe im just partly yellow and partly the type that doesnt give much of a damn if they lose their gloves
134,one of my troubles is i never care too much when i lose somethingit used to drive my mother crazy when i was a kid
61,some guys spend days looking for something they lost
68,i never seem to have anything that if i lost it id care too much
33,maybe thats why im partly yellow
21,its no excuse though
15,it really isnt
40,what you should be is not yellow at all
104,if youre supposed to sock somebody in the jaw and you sort of feel like doing it you should do it
30,im just no good at it though
101,id rather push a guy out the window or chop his head off with an ax than sock him in the jaw
18,i hate fist fights
151,i dont mind getting hit so muchalthough im not crazy about it naturallybut what scares me most in a fist fight is the guys face
59,i cant stand looking at the other guys face is my trouble
69,it wouldnt be so bad if you could both be blindfolded or something
94,its a funny kind of yellowness when you come to think of it but its yellowness all right
22,im not kidding myself
176,the more i thought about my gloves and my yellowness the more depressed i got and i decided while i was walking and all to stop off and have a drink somewhere
81,id only had three drinks at ernies and i didnt even finish the last one
44,one thing i have its a terrific capacity
68,i can drink all night and not even show it if im in the mood
168,once at the whooton school this other boy raymond goldfarb and i bought a pint of scotch and drank it in the chapel one saturday night where nobodyd see us
56,he got stinking but i hardly didnt even show it
38,i just got very cool and nonchalant
78,i puked before i went to bed but i didnt really have toi forced myself
168,anyway before i got to the hotel i started to go in this dumpylooking bar but two guys came out drunk as hell and wanted to know where the subway was
130,one of them was this very cubanlooking guy and he kept breathing his stinking breath in my face while i gave him directions
43,i ended up not even going in the damn bar
31,i just went back to the hotel
25,the whole lobby was empty
47,it smelled like fifty million dead cigars
13,it really did
60,i wasnt sleepy or anything but i was feeling sort of lousy
18,depressed and all
27,i almost wished i was dead
45,then all of a sudden i got in this big mess
121,the first thing when i got in the elevator the elevator guy said to me innarested in having a good time fella
24,or is it too late for you
15, how do you mean
50,i didnt know what he was driving at or anything
35,innarested in a little tail tnight
133,which was a very dumb answer but its quite embarrassing when somebody comes right up and asks you a question like that
21,how old are you chief
23, the elevator guy said
16,well how bout it
11,yinnarested
18,five bucks a throw
31,fifteen bucks the whole night
30, he looked at his wrist watch
46,five bucks a throw fifteen bucks till noon
12,  okay i said
94,it was against my principles and all but i was feeling so depressed i didnt even think
25,thats the whole trouble
53,when youre feeling very depressed you cant even think
22,a throw or till noon
12,i gotta know
15,  just a throw
21,   okay what room ya in
62,  i looked at the red thing with my number on it on my key
23,twelve twentytwo i said
89,i was already sort of sorry id let the thing start rolling but it was too late now
47,ill send a girl up in about fifteen minutes
35, he opened the doors and i got out
24,hey is she goodlooking
11, i asked him
24,i dont want any old bag
10,  no old bag
26,dont worry about it chief
12,  who do i pay
14,  her he said
14,lets go chief
53, he shut the doors practically right in my face
102,i went to my room and put some water on my hair but you cant really comb a crew cut or anything
110,then i tested to see if my breath stank from so many cigarettes and the scotch and sodas i drank at ernies
104,all you do is hold your hand under your mouth and blow your breath up toward the old nostrils
60,it didnt seem to stink much but i brushed my teeth anyway
36,then i put on another clean shirt
118,i knew i didnt have to get all dolled up for a prostitute or anything but it sort of gave me something to do
23,i was a little nervous
87,i was starting to feel pretty sexy and all but i was a little nervous anyway
48,if you want to know the truth im a virgin
12,i really am
113,ive had quite a few opportunities to lose my virginity and all but ive never got around to it yet
24,something always happens
120,for instance if youre at a girls house her parents always come home at the wrong timeor youre afraid they will
194,or if youre in the back seat of somebodys car theres always somebodys date in the front seatsome girl i meanthat always wants to know whats going on all over the whole goddam car
79,i mean some girl in front keeps turning around to see what the hells going on
31,anyway something always happens
62,i came quite close to doing it a couple of times though
36,one time in particular i remember
68,something went wrong though i dont even remember what any more
187,the thing is most of the time when youre coming pretty close to doing it with a girla girl that isnt a prostitute or anything i meanshe keeps telling you to stop
30,the trouble with me is i stop
12,most guys dont
14,i cant help it
256,you never know whether they really want you to stop or whether theyre just scared as hell or whether theyre just telling you to stop so that if you do go through with it the blamell be on you not them
24,anyway i keep stopping
52,the trouble is i get to feeling sorry for them
39,i mean most girls are so dumb and all
86,after you neck them for a while you can really watch them losing their brains
79,you take a girl when she really gets passionate she just hasnt any brains
10,i dont know
32,they tell me to stop so i stop
74,i always wish i hadnt after i take them home but i keep doing it anyway
104,anyway while i was putting on another clean shirt i sort of figured this was my big chance in a way
134,i figured if she was a prostitute and all i could get in some practice on her in case i ever get married or anything
34,i worry about that stuff sometimes
108,i read this book once at the whooton school that had this very sophisticated suave sexy guy in it
58,monsieur blanchard was his name i can still remember
67,it was a lousy book but this blanchard guy was pretty good
131,he had this big chteau and all on the riviera in europe and all he did in his spare time was beat women off with a club
58,he was a real rake and all but he knocked women out
137,he said in this one part that a womans body is like a violin and all and that it takes a terrific musician to play it right
106,it was a very corny booki realize thatbut i couldnt get that violin stuff out of my mind anyway
91,in a way thats why i sort of wanted to get some practice in in case i ever get married
33,caulfield and his magic violin boy
45,its corny i realize but it isnt too corny
49,i wouldnt mind being pretty good at that stuff
203,half the time if you really want to know the truth when im horsing around with a girl i have a helluva lot of trouble just finding what im looking for for gods sake if you know what i mean
96,take this girl that i just missed having sexual intercourse with that i told you about
64,it took me about an hour to just get her goddam brassiere off
72,by the time i did get it off she was about ready to spit in my eye
84,anyway i kept walking around the room waiting for this prostitute to show up
30,i kept hoping shed be goodlooking
31,i didnt care too much though
41,i sort of just wanted to get it over with
158,finally somebody knocked on the door and when i went to open it i had my suitcase right in the way and i fell over it and damn near broke my knee
69,i always pick a gorgeous time to fall over a suitcase or something
60,when i opened the door this prostitute was standing there
35,she had a polo coat on and no hat
66,she was sort of a blonde but you could tell she dyed her hair
28,she wasnt any old bag though
21,how do you do i said
17,suave as hell boy
27,you the guy maurice said
14, she asked me
34,she didnt seem too goddam friendly
23,is he the elevator boy
13, yeah she said
17,come in wont you
57,i was getting more and more nonchalant as it went along
11,i really was
83,she came in and took her coat off right away and sort of chucked it on the bed
38,she had on a green dress underneath
142,then she sort of sat down sideways on the chair that went with the desk in the room and started jiggling her foot up and down
74,she crossed her legs and started jiggling this one foot up and down
39,she was very nervous for a prostitute
14,she really was
45,i think it was because she was young as hell
22,she was around my age
73,i sat down in the big chair next to her and offered her a cigarette
21,i dont smoke she said
40,she had a tiny little wheenywhiny voice
23,you could hardly hear her
70,she never said thank you either when you offered her something
32,she just didnt know any better
30,allow me to introduce myself
29,my name is jim steele i said
20,ya got a watch on ya
53,she didnt care what the hell my name was naturally
27,hey how old are you anyways
21,   like fun you are
31,  it was a funny thing to say
28,it sounded like a real kid
120,youd think a prostitute and all would say like hell you are or cut the crap instead of like fun you are
17, how old are you
11, i asked her
34,old enough to know better she said
20,she was really witty
22,ya got a watch on ya
77, she asked me again and then she stood up and pulled her dress over her head
47,i certainly felt peculiar when she did that
38,i mean she did it so sudden and all
128,i know youre supposed to feel pretty sexy when somebody gets up and pulls their dress over their head but i didnt
46,sexy was about the last thing i was feeling
38,i felt much more depressed than sexy
23,ya got a watch on ya hey
17,no i dont i said
24,boy was i feeling peculiar
15,whats your name
12, i asked her
37,all she had on was this pink slip
32,it was really quite embarrassing
12,it really was
13,sunny she said
12,lets go hey
43,   dont you feel like talking for a while
12, i asked her
74,it was a childish thing to say but i was feeling so damn peculiar
27,are you in a very big hurry
40,  she looked at me like i was a madman
38,what the heck ya wanna talk about
11,i dont know
15,nothing special
65,i just thought perhaps you might care to chat for a while
58,  she sat down in the chair next to the desk again
42,she didnt like it though you could tell
63,she started jiggling her foot againboy she was a nervous girl
35,would you care for a cigarette now
25,i forgot she didnt smoke
11,i dont smoke
35,listen if youre gonna talk do it
22,i got things to do
53,   i couldnt think of anything to talk about though
102,i thought of asking her how she got to be a prostitute and all but i was scared to ask her
42,she probably wouldntve told me anyway
34,you dont come from new york do you
15, i said finally
29,thats all i could think of
19,hollywood she said
80,then she got up and went over to where shed put her dress down on the bed
15,ya got a hanger
43,i dont want to get my dress all wrinkly
15,its brandclean
24,  sure i said right away
52,i was only too glad to get up and do something
58,i took her dress over to the closet and hung it up for her
12,it was funny
49,it made me feel sort of sad when i hung it up
119,i thought of her going in a store and buying it and nobody in the store knowing she was a prostitute and all
82,the salesman probably just thought she was a regular girl when she bought it
54,it made me feel sad as helli dont know why exactly
69,i sat down again and tried to keep the old conversation going
35,she was a lousy conversationalist
25,do you work every night
56, i asked herit sounded sort of awful after id said it
41, she was walking all around the room
51,she picked up the menu off the desk and read it
33,what do you do during the day
37,  she sort of shrugged her shoulders
22,she was pretty skinny
15,go to the show
36, she put down the menu and looked at me
11,lets go hey
31,i havent got all  look i said
42,i dont feel very much like myself tonight
22,ive had a rough night
14,honest to god
66,ill pay you and all but do you mind very much if we dont do it
22,do you mind very much
43, the trouble was i just didnt want to do it
64,i felt more depressed than sexy if you want to know the truth
18,she was depressing
49,her green dress hanging in the closet and all
107,and besides i dont think i could ever do it with somebody that sits in a stupid movie all day long
30,i really dont think i could
92,she came over to me with this funny look on her face like as if she didnt believe me
13,whatsa matter
19,nothings the matter
28, boy was i getting nervous
47,the thing is i had an operation very recently
36,  on my wuddayacallitmy clavichord
23,where the hells that
14,  the clavichord
39,well actually its in the spinal canal
52,i mean its quite a ways down in the spinal canal
10,thats tough
34, then she sat down on my goddam lap
63,  she made me so nervous i just kept on lying my head off
32,im still recuperating i told her
35,you look like a guy in the movies
20,you know who i mean
24,what the hecks his name
19, i dont know i said
35,she wouldnt get off my goddam lap
12,sure you know
46,he was in that pitcher with melvine douglas
50,the one that was melvine douglass kid brother
25,that falls off this boat
20,you know who i mean
11,  no i dont
38,i go to the movies as seldom as i can
35, then she started getting funny
14,crude and all
27,do you mind cutting it out
35,im not in the mood i just told you
23,i just had an operation
95,  she didnt get up from my lap or anything but she gave me this terrifically dirty look
14,listen she said
56,i was sleepin when that crazy maurice woke me up
57,if you think im  i said id pay you for coming and all
13,i really will
22,i have plenty of dough
151,its just that im practically just recovering from a very serious  what the heck did you tell that crazy maurice you wanted a girl for then
77,if you just had a goddam operation on your goddam wuddayacallit
49,  i thought id be feeling a lot better than i do
44,i was a little premature in my calculations
53,if youll just get up a second ill get my wallet
125,  she was sore as hell but she got up off my goddam lap so that i could go over and get my wallet off the chiffonier
50,i took out a fivedollar bill and handed it to her
24,thanks a lot i told her
16,thanks a million
16, this is a five
12,it costs ten
40,   she was getting funny you could tell
57,i was afraid something like that would happeni really was
27,maurice said five i told her
51,he said fifteen till noon and only five for a throw
17, ten for a throw
15,   he said five
55,im sorryi really ambut thats all im gonna shell out
128,  she sort of shrugged her shoulders the way she did before and then she said very cold do you mind getting me my frock
36,or would it be too much trouble
32, she was a pretty spooky kid
88,even with that little bitty voice she had she could sort of scare you a little bit
118,if shed been a big old prostitute with a lot of makeup on her face and all she wouldnt have been half as spooky
36,i went and got her dress for her
76,she put it on and all and then she picked up her polo coat off the bed
26,so long crumbbum she said
15,so long i said
33,i didnt thank her or anything
16,im glad i didnt
102,   after old sunny was gone i sat in the chair for a while and smoked a couple of cigarettes
31,it was getting daylight outside
21,boy i felt miserable
37,i felt so depressed you cant imagine
55,what i did i started talking sort of out loud to allie
46,i do that sometimes when i get very depressed
96,i keep telling him to go home and get his bike and meet me in front of bobby fallons house
67,bobby fallon used to live quite near us in mainethis is years ago
102,anyway what happened was one day bobby and i were going over to lake sedebego on our bikes
145,we were going to take our lunches and all and our bb gunswe were kids and all and we thought we could shoot something with our bb guns
87,anyway allie heard us talking about it and he wanted to go and i wouldnt let him
27,i told him he was a child
78,so once in a while now when i get very depressed i keep saying to him okay
70,go home and get your bike and meet me in front of bobbys house
84, it wasnt that i didnt use to take him with me when i went somewhere
26,but that one day i didnt
130,he didnt get sore about ithe never got sore about anything but i keep thinking about it anyway when i get very depressed
50,finally though i got undressed and got in bed
79,i felt like praying or something when i was in bed but i couldnt do it
40,i cant always pray when i feel like it
43,in the first place im sort of an atheist
95,i like jesus and all but i dont care too much for most of the other stuff in the bible
33,take the disciples for instance
67,they annoy the hell out of me if you want to know the truth
146,they were all right after jesus was dead and all but while he was alive they were about as much use to him as a hole in the head
43,all they did was keep letting him down
66,i like almost anybody in the bible better than the disciples
178,if you want to know the truth the guy i like best in the bible next to jesus was that lunatic and all that lived in the tombs and kept cutting himself with stones
64,i like him ten times as much as the disciples that poor bastard
148,i used to get in quite a few arguments about it when i was at whooton school with this boy that lived down the corridor arthur childs
76,old childs was a quaker and all and he read the bible all the time
150,he was a very nice kid and i liked him but i could never see eye to eye with him on a lot of stuff in the bible especially the disciples
84,he kept telling me if i didnt like the disciples then i didnt like jesus and all
89,he said that because jesus picked the disciples you were supposed to like them
64,i said i knew he picked them but that he picked them at random
62,i said he didnt have time to go around analyzing everybody
41,i said i wasnt blaming jesus or anything
45,it wasnt his fault that he didnt have any time
143,i remember i asked old childs if he thought judas the one that betrayed jesus and all went to hell after he committed suicide
21,childs said certainly
46,thats exactly where i disagreed with him
74,i said id bet a thousand bucks that jesus never sent old judas to hell
45,i still would too if i had a thousand bucks
125,i think any one of the disciples wouldve sent him to hell and alland fast toobut ill bet anything jesus didnt do it
87,old childs said the trouble with me was that i didnt go to church or anything
34,he was right about that in a way
112,in the first place my parents are different religions and all the children in our family are atheists
64,if you want to know the truth i cant even stand ministers
138,the ones theyve had at every school ive gone to they all have these holy joe voices when they start giving their sermons
14,god i hate that
62,i dont see why the hell they cant talk in their natural voice
34,they sound so phony when they talk
58,anyway when i was in bed i couldnt pray worth a damn
87,every time i got started i kept picturing old sunny calling me a crumbbum
61,finally i sat up in bed and smoked another cigarette
16,it tasted lousy
61,i mustve smoked around two packs since i left pencey
84,all of a sudden while i was laying there smoking somebody knocked on the door
91,i kept hoping it wasnt my door they were knocking on but i knew damn well it was
35,i dont know how i knew but i knew
20,i knew who it was too
17,i was pretty scared
33,im very yellow about those things
33,they just knocked again though
78,finally i got out of bed with just my pajamas on and opened the door
86,i didnt even have to turn the light on in the room because it was already daylight
74,old sunny and maurice the pimpy elevator guy were standing there
18,whats the matter
13,wuddaya want
37,boy my voice was shaking like hell
28,nothin much old maurice said
15,just five bucks
46, he did all the talking for the two of them
76,old sunny just stood there next to him with her mouth open and all
18,i paid her already
22,i gave her five bucks
13,ask her i said
25,boy was my voice shaking
19,its ten bucks chief
14,i tole ya that
47,ten bucks for a throw fifteen bucks till noon
15,i tole ya that
29,  you did not tell me that
29,you said five bucks a throw
87,you said fifteen bucks till noon all right but i distinctly heard you open up chief
11,   what for
63,god my old heart was damn near beating me out of the room
32,i wished i was dressed at least
76,its terrible to be just in your pajamas when something like that happens
32,lets go chief old maurice said
53,then he gave me a big shove with his crumby hand
60,i damn near fell over on my canhe was a huge sonuvabitch
64,the next thing i knew he and old sunny were both in the room
41,they acted like they owned the damn place
40,old sunny sat down on the window sill
123,old maurice sat down in the big chair and loosened his collar and allhe was wearing this elevator operators uniform
18,boy was i nervous
28,all right chief lets have it
27,i gotta get back to work
52, i told you about ten times i dont owe you a cent
49,i already gave her the five  cut the crap now
11,lets have it
45,   why should i give her another five bucks
43,my voice was cracking all over the place
25,youre trying to chisel me
51,  old maurice unbuttoned his whole uniform coat
80,all he had on underneath was a phony shirt collar but no shirt or anything
31,he had a big fat hairy stomach
39,nobodys tryna chisel nobody he said
19,lets have it chief
91,   when i said that he got up from his chair and started walking towards me and all
65,he looked like he was very very tired or very very bored
17,god was i scared
40,i sort of had my arms folded i remember
87,it wouldnt have been so bad i dont think if i hadnt had just my goddam pajamas on
16,lets have it chief
44, he came right up to where i was standing
24,thats all he could say
19,lets have it chief
21, he was a real moron
63,  chief youre gonna force me inna roughin ya up a little bit
57,i dont wanna do it but thats the way it looks he said
24,you owe us five bucks
36,  i dont owe you five bucks i said
39,if you rough me up ill yell like hell
37,ill wake up everybody in the hotel
19,the police and all
40, my voice was shaking like a bastard
28,yell your goddam head off
21,fine old maurice said
67,want your parents to know you spent the night with a whore
24,highclass kid like you
40, he was pretty sharp in his crumby way
13,he really was
13,leave me alone
34,if youd said ten itd be different
51,but you distinctly   are ya gonna let us have it
46, he had me right up against the damn door
80,he was almost standing on top of me his crumby old hairy stomach and all
13,leave me alone
32,get the hell out of my room i said
37,i still had my arms folded and all
23,god what a jerk i was
45,then sunny said something for the first time
10,hey maurice
26,want me to get his wallet
36,its right on the wutchamacallit
13, yeah get it
23,   leave my wallet alone
29,  i awreddy got it sunny said
27,she waved five bucks at me
36,all im takin is the five you owe me

34,  all of a sudden i started to cry

30,no youre no crooks i said

31,leave him alone hey sunny said

23,i mean it maurice hey

65,then what he did he snapped his finger very hard on my pajamas
61,i wont tell you where he snapped it but it hurt like hell
41,i told him he was a goddam dirty moron
54,he put his hand behind his ear like a deaf guy
28,  i was still sort of crying
40,i was so damn mad and nervous and all
26,youre a dirty moron i said
180,youre a stupid chiseling moron and in about two years youll be one of those scraggy guys that come up to you on the street and ask for a dime for coffee
95,youll have snot all over your dirty filthy overcoat and youll be  then he smacked me
64,i didnt even try to get out of the way or duck or anything
53,all i felt was this terrific punch in my stomach
146,i wasnt knocked out or anything though because i remember looking up from the floor and seeing them both go out the door and shut it
87,then i stayed on the floor a fairly long time sort of the way i did with stradlater
37,only this time i thought i was dying
12,i really did
38,i thought i was drowning or something
39,the trouble was i could hardly breathe
116,when i did finally get up i had to walk to the bathroom all doubled up and holding onto my stomach and all
13,but im crazy
18,i swear to god i am
94,about halfway to the bathroom i sort of started pretending i had a bullet in my guts
26,old maurice had plugged me
169,now i was on the way to the bathroom to get a good shot of bourbon or something to steady my nerves and help me really go into action
151,i pictured myself coming out of the goddam bathroom dressed and all with my automatic in my pocket and staggering around a little bit
58,then id walk downstairs instead of using the elevator
118,id hold onto the banister and all with this blood trickling out of the side of my mouth a little at a time
136,what id do id walk down a few floorsholding onto my guts blood leaking all over the place and then id ring the elevator bell
192,as soon as old maurice opened the doors hed see me with the automatic in my hand and hed start screaming at me in this very highpitched yellowbelly voice to leave him alone
21,but id plug him anyway
50,six shots right through his fat hairy belly
119,then id throw my automatic down the elevator shaftafter id wiped off all the finger prints and all
101,then id crawl back to my room and call up jane and have her come over and bandage up my guts
82,i pictured her holding a cigarette for me to smoke while i was bleeding and all
17,the goddam movies
18,they can ruin you
15,im not kidding
69,i stayed in the bathroom for about an hour taking a bath and all
22,then i got back in bed
81,it took me quite a while to get to sleepi wasnt even tiredbut finally i did
58,what i really felt like though was committing suicide
36,i felt like jumping out the window
93,i probably wouldve done it too if id been sure somebodyd cover me up as soon as i landed
83,i didnt want a bunch of stupid rubbernecks looking at me when i was all gory
97,   i didnt sleep too long because i think it was only around ten oclock when i woke up
54,i felt pretty hungry as soon as i had a cigarette
130,the last time id eaten was those two hamburgers i had with brossard and ackley when we went in to agerstown to the movies
25,that was a long time ago
34,it seemed like fifty years ago
173,the phone was right next to me and i started to call down and have them send up some breakfast but i was sort of afraid they might send it up with old maurice
59,if you think i was dying to see him again youre crazy
74,so i just laid around in bed for a while and smoked another cigarette
102,i thought of giving old jane a buzz to see if she was home yet and all but i wasnt in the mood
48,what i did do i gave old sally hayes a buzz
122,she went to mary a woodruff and  i knew she was home because id had this letter from her a couple of weeks ago
58,i wasnt too crazy about her but id known her for years
61,i used to think she was quite intelligent in my stupidity
122,the reason i did was because she knew quite a lot about the theater and plays and literature and all that stuff
140,if somebody knows quite a lot about those things it takes you quite a while to find out whether theyre really stupid or not
52,it took me years to find it out in old sallys case
77,i think id have found it out a lot sooner if we hadnt necked so damn much
98,my big trouble is i always sort of think whoever im necking is a pretty intelligent person
77,it hasnt got a goddam thing to do with it but i keep thinking it anyway
22,anyway i gave her a buzz
24,first the maid answered
15,then her father
16,then she got on
14,yeswho is this
29,she was quite a little phony
39,id already told her father who it was
17,holden caulfield
10,how are you
18,how are ya anyway
19,i mean hows school
16,  fine she said
16,i meanyou know
11,well listen
42,i was wondering if you were busy today
70,its sunday but theres always one or two matinees going on sunday
23,benefits and that stuff
22,would you care to go
10,  id love to
34,if theres one word i hate its grand
12,its so phony
69,for a second i was tempted to tell her to forget about the matinee
33,but we chewed the fat for a while
20,that is she chewed it
37,you couldnt get a word in edgewise
140,first she told me about some harvard guy it probably was a freshman but she didnt say naturallythat was rushing hell out of her
29,calling her up night and day
30,night and daythat killed me
111,then she told me about some other guy some west point cadet that was cutting his throat over her too
150,i told her to meet me under the clock at the biltmore at two oclock and not to be late because the show probably started at twothirty
19,she was always late
14,then i hung up
63,she gave me a pain in the ass but she was very goodlooking
99,after i made the date with old sally i got out of bed and got dressed and packed my bag
146,i took a look out the window before i left the room though to see how all the perverts were doing but they all had their shades down
51,they were the heighth of modesty in the morning
50,then i went down in the elevator and checked out
39,i didnt see old maurice around anywhere
64,i didnt break my neck looking for him naturally the bastard
91,i got a cab outside the hotel but i didnt have the faintest damn idea where i was going
20,i had no place to go
83,it was only sunday and i couldnt go home till wednesdayor tuesday the soonest
97,and i certainly didnt feel like going to another hotel and getting my brains beat out
71,so what i did i told the driver to take me to grand central station
209,it was right near the biltmore where i was meeting sally later and i figured what id do id check my bags in one of those strong boxes that they give you a key to then get some breakfast
20,i was sort of hungry
84,while i was in the cab i took out my wallet and sort of counted my money
79,i dont remember exactly what i had left but it was no fortune or anything
50,id spent a kings ransom in about two lousy weeks
11,i really had
34,im a goddam spendthrift at heart
24,what i dont spend i lose
106,half the time i sort of even forget to pick up my change at restaurants and night clubs and all
26,it drives my parents crazy
19,you cant blame them
32,my fathers quite wealthy though
100,i dont know how much he makeshes never discussed that stuff with mebut i imagine quite a lot
24,hes a corporation lawyer
29,those boys really haul it in
96,another reason i know hes quite well off hes always investing money in shows on broadway
75,they always flop though and it drives my mother crazy when he does it
59,she hasnt felt too healthy since my brother allie died
17,shes very nervous
82,thats another reason why i hated like hell for her to know i got the ax again
138,after i put my bags in one of those strong boxes at the station i went into this little sandwich bar and bad breakfast
88,i had quite a large breakfast for meorange juice bacon and eggs toast and coffee
41,usually i just drink some orange juice
21,im a very light eater
11,i really am
28,thats why im so damn skinny
131,i was supposed to be on this diet where you eat a lot of starches and crap to gain weight and all but i didnt ever do it
93,when im out somewhere i generally just eat a swiss cheese sandwich and a malted milk
69,it isnt much but you get quite a lot of vitamins in the malted milk
13,h v caulfield
23,holden vitamin caulfield
223,while i was eating my eggs these two nuns with suitcases and alli guessed they were moving to another convent or something and were waiting for a traincame in and sat down next to me at the counter
97,they didnt seem to know what the hell to do with their suitcases so i gave them a hand
112,they were these very inexpensivelooking suitcasesthe ones that arent genuine leather or anything
76,it isnt important i know but i hate it when somebody has cheap suitcases
139,it sounds terrible to say it but i can even get to hate somebody just looking at them if they have cheap suitcases with them
24,something happened once
126,for a while when i was at elkton hills i roomed with this boy dick slagle that had these very inexpensive suitcases
127,he used to keep them under the bed instead of on the rack so that nobodyd see them standing next to mine
117,it depressed holy hell out of me and i kept wanting to throw mine out or something or even trade with him
123,mine came from mark cross and they were genuine cowhide and all that crap and i guess they cost quite a pretty penny
24,but it was a funny thing
22,heres what happened
175,what i did i finally put my suitcases under my bed instead of on the rack so that old slagle wouldnt get a goddam inferiority complex about it
21,but heres what he did
93,the day after i put mine under my bed he took them out and put them back on the rack
117,the reason he did it it took me a while to find out was because he wanted people to think my bags were his
12,he really did
32,he was a very funny guy that way
78,he was always saying snotty things about them my suitcases for instance
51,he kept saying they were too new and bourgeois
32,that was his favorite goddam word
47,he read it somewhere or heard it somewhere
40,everything i had was bourgeois as hell
37,even my fountain pen was bourgeois
63,he borrowed it off me all the time but it was bourgeois anyway
42,we only roomed together about two months
33,then we both asked to be moved
158,and the funny thing was i sort of missed him after we moved because he had a helluva good sense of humor and we had a lot of fun sometimes
46,i wouldnt be surprised if he missed me too
132,at first he only used to be kidding when he called my stuff bourgeois and i didnt give a damnit was sort of funny in fact
65,then after a while you could tell he wasnt kidding any more
183,the thing is its really hard to be roommates with people if your suitcases are much better than theirsif yours are really good ones and theirs arent
171,you think if theyre intelligent and all the other person and have a good sense of humor that they dont give a damn whose suitcases are better but they do
14,they really do
84,its one of the reasons why i roomed with a stupid bastard like stradlater
44,at least his suitcases were as good as mine
93,anyway these two nuns were sitting next to me and we sort of struck up a conversation
153,the one right next to me had one of those straw baskets that you see nuns and salvation army babes collecting dough with around christmas time
120,you see them standing on corners especially on fifth avenue in front of the big department stores and all
103,anyway the one next to me dropped hers on the floor and i reached down and picked it up for her
68,i asked her if she was out collecting money for charity and all
10,she said no
108,she said she couldnt get it in her suitcase when she was packing it and she was just carrying it
53,she had a pretty nice smile when she looked at you
137,she had a big nose and she had on those glasses with sort of iron rims that arent too attractive but she had a helluva kind face
93,i thought if you were taking up a collection i told her i could make a small contribution
71,you could keep the money for when you do take up a collection
89,  oh how very kind of you she said and the other one her friend looked over at me
79,the other one was reading a little black book while she drank her coffee
46,it looked like a bible but it was too skinny
32,it was a bibletype book though
74,all the two of them were eating for breakfast was toast and coffee
18,that depressed me
127,i hate it if im eating bacon and eggs or something and somebody else is only eating toast and coffee
54,they let me give them ten bucks as a contribution
68,they kept asking me if i was sure i could afford it and all
96,i told them i had quite a bit of money with me but they didnt seem to believe me
27,they took it though finally
66,the both of them kept thanking me so much it was embarrassing
107,i swung the conversation around to general topics and asked them where they were going
218,they said they were schoolteachers and that theyd just come from chicago and that they were going to start teaching at some convent on th street or th street or one of those streets way the hell uptown
129,the one next to me with the iron glasses said she taught english and her friend taught history and american government
189,then i started wondering like a bastard what the one sitting next to me that taught english thought about being a nun and all when she read certain books for english
99,books not necessarily with a lot of sexy stuff in them but books with lovers and all in them
65,take old eustacia vye in the return of the native by thomas hardy
140,she wasnt too sexy or anything but even so you cant help wondering what a nun maybe thinks about when she reads about old eustacia
39,i didnt say anything though naturally
43,all i said was english was my best subject
13,oh im so glad
55, the one with the glasses that taught english said
30,what have you read this year
33,id be very interested to know
21, she was really nice
48,well most of the time we were on the anglosaxons
73,beowulf and old grendel and lord randal my son and all those things
72,but we had to read outside books for extra credit once in a while
122,i read the return of the native by thomas hardy and romeo and juliet and julius  oh romeo and juliet
23,didnt you just love it
46, she certainly didnt sound much like a nun
17,i liked it a lot
86,there were a few things i didnt like about it but it was quite moving on the whole
33,  what didnt you like about it
16,can you remember
114, to tell you the truth it was sort of embarrassing in a way to be talking about romeo and juliet with her
144,i mean that play gets pretty sexy in some parts and she was a nun and all but she asked me so i discussed it with her for a while
53,well im not too crazy about romeo and juliet i said
35,i mean i like them buti dont know
37,they get pretty annoying sometimes
92,i mean i felt much sorrier when old mercutio got killed than when romeo and juliet did
128,the think is i never liked romeo too much after mercutio gets stabbed by that other manjuliets cousinwhats his name
14,  thats right
47,tybalt i saidi always forget that guys name
19,it was romeos fault
59,i mean i liked him the best in the play old mercutio
10,i dont know
117,all those montagues and capulets theyre all rightespecially julietbut mercutio he wasits hard to explain
48,he was very smart and entertaining and all
154,the thing is it drives me crazy if somebody gets killed especially somebody very smart and entertaining and alland its somebody elses fault
48,romeo and juliet at least it was their own fault
29,  what school do you go to
12, she asked me
73,she probably wanted to get off the subject of romeo and juliet
41,i told her pencey and shed heard of it
37,she said it was a very good school
21,i let it pass though
108,then the other one the one that taught history and government said theyd better be running along
62,i took their check off them but they wouldnt let me pay it
58,the one with the glasses made me give it back to her
46,youve been more than generous she said
22,youre a very sweet boy
28, she certainly was nice
89,she reminded me a little bit of old ernest morrows mother the one i met on the train
20,when she smiled mostly
45,weve enjoyed talking to you so much she said
45,i said id enjoyed talking to them a lot too
14,i meant it too
192,id have enjoyed it even more though i think if i hadnt been sort of afraid the whole time i was talking to them that theyd all of a sudden try to find out if i was a catholic
62,catholics are always trying to find out if youre a catholic
124,it happens to me a lot i know partly because my last name is irish and most people of irish descent are catholics
53,as a matter of fact my father was a catholic once
45,he quit though when he married my mother
119,but catholics are always trying to find out if youre a catholic even if they dont know your last name
81,i knew this one catholic boy louis shaney when i was at the whooton school
39,he was the first boy i ever met there
209,he and i were sitting in the first two chairs outside the goddam infirmary the day school opened waiting for our physicals and we sort of struck up this conversation about tennis
50,he was quite interested in tennis and so was i
207,he told me he went to the nationals at forest hills every summer and i told him i did too and then we talked about certain hotshot tennis players for quite a while
59,he knew quite a lot about tennis for a kid his age
12,he really did
172,then after a while right in the middle of the goddam conversation he asked me did you happen to notice where the catholic church is in town by any chance
117, the thing was you could tell by the way he asked me that he was trying to find out if i was a catholic
13,he really was
67,not that he was prejudiced or anything but he just wanted to know
145,he was enjoying the conversation about tennis and all but you could tell he wouldve enjoyed it more if i was a catholic and all
37,that kind of stuff drives me crazy
109,im not saying it ruined our conversation or anythingit didntbut it sure as hell didnt do it any good
79,thats why i was glad those two nuns didnt ask me if i was a catholic
102,it wouldnt have spoiled the conversation if they had but it wouldve been different probably
34,im not saying i blame catholics
55,id be the same way probably if i was a catholic
67,its just like those suitcases i was telling you about in a way
60,all im saying is that its no good for a nice conversation
21,thats all im saying
88,when they got up to go the two nuns i did something very stupid and embarrassing
121,i was smoking a cigarette and when i stood up to say goodby to them by mistake i blew some smoke in their face
30,i didnt mean to but i did it
122,i apologized like a madman and they were very polite and nice about it but it was very embarrassing anyway
102,after they left i started getting sorry that id only given them ten bucks for their collection
151,but the thing was id made that date to go to a matinee with old sally hayes and i needed to keep some dough for the tickets and stuff
26,i was sorry anyway though
13,goddam money
47,it always ends up making you blue as hell
139,   after i had my breakfast it was only around noon and i wasnt meeting old sally till two oclock so i started taking this long walk
48,i couldnt stop thinking about those two nuns
135,i kept thinking about that beatup old straw basket they went around collecting money with when they werent teaching school
220,i kept trying to picture my mother or somebody or my aunt or sally hayess crazy mother standing outside some department store and collecting dough for poor people in a beatup old straw basket
22,it was hard to picture
43,not so much my mother but those other two
232,my aunts pretty charitableshe does a lot of red cross work and allbut shes very welldressed and all and when she does anything charitable shes always very welldressed and has lipstick on and all that crap
139,i couldnt picture her doing anything for charity if she had to wear black clothes and no lipstick while she was doing it
29,and old sally hayess mother
13,jesus christ
147,the only way she could go around with a basket collecting dough would be if everybody kissed her ass for her when they made a contribution
159,if they just dropped their dough in her basket then walked away without saying anything to her ignoring her and all shed quit in about an hour
13,shed get bored
69,shed hand in her basket and then go someplace swanky for lunch
37,thats what i liked about those nuns
81,you could tell for one thing that they never went anywhere swanky for lunch
110,it made me so damn sad when i thought about it their never going anywhere swanky for lunch or anything
65,i knew it wasnt too important but it made me sad anyway
119,i started walking over toward broadway just for the hell of it because i hadnt been over there in years
65,besides i wanted to find a record store that was open on sunday
83,there was this record i wanted to get for phoebe called little shirley beans
35, it was a very hard record to get
141,it was about a little kid that wouldnt go out of the house because two of her front teeth were out and she was ashamed to
21,i heard it at pencey
154,a boy that lived on the next floor had it and i tried to buy it off him because i knew it would knock old phoebe out but he wouldnt sell it
116,it was a very old terrific record that this colored girl singer estelle fletcher made about twenty years ago
80,she sings it very dixieland and whorehouse and it doesnt sound at all mushy
180,if a white girl was singing it shed make it sound cute as hell but old estelle fletcher knew what the hell she was doing and it was one of the best records i ever heard
112,i figured id buy it in some store that was open on sunday and then id take it up to the park with me
89,it was sunday and phoebe goes rollerskating in the park on sundays quite frequently
34,i knew where she hung out mostly
117,it wasnt as cold as it was the day before but the sun still wasnt out and it wasnt too nice for walking
30,but there was one nice thing
161,this family that you could tell just came out of some church were walking right in front of mea father a mother and a little kid about six years old
26,they looked sort of poor
115,the father had on one of those pearlgray hats that poor guys wear a lot when they want to look sharp
94,he and his wife were just walking along talking not paying any attention to their kid
16,the kid was swell
89,he was walking in the street instead of on the sidewalk but right next to the curb
136,he was making out like he was walking a very straight line the way kids do and the whole time he kept singing and humming
55,i got up closer so i could hear what he was singing
78,he was singing that song if a body catch a body coming through the rye
38, he had a pretty little voice too
56,he was just singing for the hell of it you could tell
207,the cars zoomed by brakes screeched all over the place his parents paid no attention to him and he kept on walking next to the curb and singing if a body catch a body coming through the rye
21, it made me feel better
45,it made me feel not so depressed any more
31,broadway was mobbed and messy
75,it was sunday and only about twelve oclock but it was mobbed anyway
131,everybody was on their way to the moviesthe paramount or the astor or the strand or the capitol or one of those crazy places
76,everybody was all dressed up because it was sunday and that made it worse
84,but the worst part was that you could tell they all wanted to go to the movies
33,i couldnt stand looking at them
231,i can understand somebody going to the movies because theres nothing else to do but when somebody really wants to go and even walks fast so as to get there quicker then it depresses hell out of me
182,especially if i see millions of people standing in one of those long terrible lines all the way down the block waiting with this terrific patience for seats and all
60,boy i couldnt get off that goddam broadway fast enough
10,i was lucky
79,the first record store i went into had a copy of little shirley beans
93, they charged me five bucks for it because it was so hard to get but i didnt care
42,boy it made me so happy all of a sudden
110,i could hardly wait to get to the park to see if old phoebe was around so that i could give it to her
78,when i came out of the record store i passed this drugstore and i went in
94,i figured maybe id give old jane a buzz and see if she was home for vacation yet
48,so i went in a phone booth and called her up
76,the only trouble was her mother answered the phone so i had to hang up
80,i didnt feel like getting involved in a long conversation and all with her
68,im not crazy about talking to girls mothers on the phone anyway
64,i shouldve at least asked her if jane was home yet though
28,it wouldnt have killed me
26,but i didnt feel like it
49,you really have to be in the mood for that stuff
126,i still had to get those damn theater tickets so i bought a paper and looked up to see what shows were playing
77,on account of it was sunday there were only about three shows playing
84,so what i did was i went over and bought two orchestra seats for i know my love
43,it was a benefit performance or something
213,i didnt much want to see it but i knew old sally the queen of the phonies would start drooling all over the place when i told her i had tickets for that because the lunts were in it and all
102,she liked shows that are supposed to be very sophisticated and dry and all with the lunts and all
64,i dont like any shows very much if you want to know the truth
77,theyre not as bad as movies but theyre certainly nothing to rave about
33,in the first place i hate actors
27,they never act like people
23,they just think they do
83,some of the good ones do in a very slight way but not in a way thats fun to watch
97,and if any actors really good you can always tell he knows hes good and that spoils it
43,you take sir laurence olivier for example
20,i saw him in hamlet
39,took phoebe and i to see it last year
52,he treated us to lunch first and then he took us
109,hed already seen it and the way he talked about it at lunch i was anxious as hell to see it too
26,but i didnt enjoy it much
76,i just dont see whats so marvelous about sir laurence olivier thats all
178,he has a terrific voice and hes a helluva handsome guy and hes very nice to watch when hes walking or dueling or something but he wasnt at all the way db
15,said hamlet was
79,he was too much like a goddam general instead of a sad screwedup type guy
204,the best part in the whole picture was when old ophelias brotherthe one that gets in the duel with hamlet at the very endwas going away and his father was giving him a lot of advice
269,while the father kept giving him a lot of advice old ophelia was sort of horsing around with her brother taking his dagger out of the holster and teasing him and all while he was trying to look interested in the bull his father was shooting
14,that was nice
29,i got a big bang out of that
42,but you dont see that kind of stuff much
83,the only thing old phoebe liked was when hamlet patted this dog on the head
47,she thought that was funny and nice and it was
54,what ill have to do is ill have to read that play
75,the trouble with me is i always have to read that stuff by myself
42,if an actor acts it out i hardly listen
80,i keep worrying about whether hes going to do something phony every minute
75,after i got the tickets to the lunts show i took a cab up to the park
160,i shouldve taken a subway or something because i was getting slightly low on dough but i wanted to get off that damn broadway as fast as i could
25,it was lousy in the park
273,it wasnt too cold but the sun still wasnt out and there didnt look like there was anything in the park except dog crap and globs of spit and cigar butts from old men and the benches all looked like theyd be wet if you sat down on them
105,it made you depressed and every once in a while for no reason you got goose flesh while you walked
52,it didnt seem at all like christmas was coming soon
40,it didnt seem like anything was coming
116,but i kept walking over to the mall anyway because thats where phoebe usually goes when shes in the park
38,she likes to skate near the bandstand
69,thats the same place i used to like to skate when i was a kid
60,when i got there though i didnt see her around anywhere
122,there were a few kids around skating and all and two boys were playing flys up with a soft ball but no phoebe
96,i saw one kid about her age though sitting on a bench all by herself tightening her skate
199,i thought maybe she might know phoebe and could tell me where she was or something so i went over and sat down next to her and asked her do you know phoebe caulfield by any chance
55,all she had on was jeans and about twenty sweaters
79,you could tell her mother made them for her because they were lumpy as hell
17,phoebe caulfield
33,she lives on seventyfirst street
58,shes in the fourth grade over at you know phoebe
21,  yeah im her brother
20,you know where she is
38,  shes in miss callons class isnt she
13, the kid said
10,i dont know
15,yes i think she is
33, shes probly in the museum then
38,we went last saturday the kid said
12,which museum
12, i asked her
36,she shrugged her shoulders sort of
21,i dont know she said
84,   i know but the one where the pictures are or the one where the indians are
26, the one where the indians
21,   thanks a lot i said
81,i got up and started to go but  then i suddenly remembered it was sunday
31,this is sunday i told the kid
19,she looked up at me
11,then she isnt
60,   she was having a helluva time tightening her skate
82,she didnt have any gloves on or anything and her hands were all red and cold
25,i gave her a hand with it
53,boy i hadnt had a skate key in my hand for years
27,it didnt feel funny though
108,you could put a skate key in my hand fifty years from now in pitch dark and id still know what it is
67,she thanked me and all when i had it tightened for her
40,she was a very nice polite little kid
97,god i love it when a kids nice and polite when you tighten their skate for them or something
13,most kids are
16,they really are
107,i asked her if shed care to have a hot chocolate or something with me but she said no thank you
37,she said she had to meet her friend
37,kids always have to meet their friend
13,that kills me
223,even though it was sunday and phoebe wouldnt be there with her class or anything and even though it was so damp and lousy out i walked all the way through the park over to the museum of natural history
64,i knew that was the museum the kid with the skate key meant
46,i knew that whole museum routine like a book
107,phoebe went to the same school i went to when i was a kid and we used to go there all the time
89,we had this teacher miss aigletinger that took us there damn near every saturday
118,sometimes we looked at the animals and sometimes we looked at the stuff the indians had made in ancient times
54,pottery and straw baskets and all stuff like that
41,i get very happy when i think about it
121,i remember after we looked at all the indian stuff usually we went to see some movie in this big auditorium
224,they were always showing columbus discovering america having one helluva time getting old ferdinand and isabella to lend him the dough to buy ships with and then the sailors mutinying on him and all
191,nobody gave too much of a damn about old columbus but you always had a lot of candy and gum and stuff with you and the inside of that auditorium had such a nice smell
144,it always smelled like it was raining outside even if it wasnt and you were in the only nice dry cosy place in the world
25,i loved that damn museum
86,i remember you had to go through the indian room to get to the auditorium
64,it was a long long room and you were only supposed to whisper
39,the teacher would go first then the class
54,youd be two rows of kids and youd have a partner
67,most of the time my partner was this girl named gertrude levine
98,she always wanted to hold your hand and her hand was always sticky or sweaty or something
288,the floor was all stone and if you had some marbles in your hand and you dropped them they bounced like madmen all over the floor and made a helluva racket and the teacher would hold up the class and go back and see what the hell was going on
45,she never got sore though miss aigletinger
286,then youd pass by this long long indian war canoe about as long as three goddam cadillacs in a row with about twenty indians in it some of them paddling some of them just standing around looking tough and they all had war paint all over their faces
77,there was one very spooky guy in the back of the canoe with a mask on
23,he was the witch doctor
50,he gave me the creeps but i liked him anyway
255,another thing if you touched one of the paddles or anything while you were passing one of the guards would say to you dont touch anything children but he always said it in a nice voice not like a goddam cop or anything
149,then youd pass by this big glass case with indians inside it rubbing sticks together to make a fire and a squaw weaving a blanket
104,the squaw that was weaving the blanket was sort of bending over and you could see her bosom and all
145,we all used to sneak a good look at it even the girls because they were only little kids and they didnt have any more bosom than we did
102,then just before you went inside the auditorium right near the doors you passed this eskimo
70,he was sitting over a hole in this icy lake and he was fishing through it
71,he had about two fish right next to the hole that hed already caught
42,boy that museum was full of glass cases
134,there were even more upstairs with deer inside them drinking at water holes and birds flying south for the winter
319,the birds nearest you were all stuffed and hung up on wires and the ones in back were just painted on the wall but they all looked like they were really flying south and if you bent your head down and sort of looked at them upside down they looked in an even bigger hurry to fly south
91,the best thing though in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was
12,nobodyd move
383,you could go there a hundred thousand times and that eskimo would still be just finished catching those two fish the birds would still be on their way south the deers would still be drinking out of that water hole with their pretty antlers and their pretty skinny legs and that squaw with the naked bosom would still be weaving that same blanket
21,nobodyd be different
57,the only thing that would be different would be you
41,not that youd be so much older or anything
27,it wouldnt be that exactly
34,youd just be different thats all
33,youd have an overcoat on this time
117,or the kid that was your partner in line the last time had got scarlet fever and youd have a new partner
75,or youd have a substitute taking the class instead of miss aigletinger
84,or youd heard your mother and father having a terrific fight in the bathroom
100,or youd just passed by one of those puddles in the street with gasoline rainbows in them
66,i mean youd be different in some wayi cant explain what i mean
53,and even if i could im not sure id feel like it
76,i took my old hunting hat out of my pocket while i walked and put it on
71,i knew i wouldnt meet anybody that knew me and it was pretty damp out
131,i kept walking and walking and i kept thinking about old phoebe going to that museum on saturdays the way i used to
106,i thought how shed see the same stuff i used to see and how shed be different every time she saw it
99,it didnt exactly depress me to think about it but it didnt make me feel gay as hell either
50,certain things they should stay the way they are
99,you ought to be able to stick them in one of those big glass cases and just leave them alone
48,i know thats impossible but its too bad anyway
57,anyway i kept thinking about all that while i walked
98,i passed by this playground and stopped and watched a couple of very tiny kids on a seesaw
186,one of them was sort of fat and i put my hand on the skinny kids end to sort of even up the weight but you could tell they didnt want me around so i let them alone
27,then a funny thing happened
93,when i got to the museum all of a sudden i wouldnt have gone inside for a million bucks
125,it just didnt appeal to meand here id walked through the whole goddam park and looked forward to it and all
61,if phoebed been there i probably would have but she wasnt
87,so all i did in front of the museum was get a cab and go down to the biltmore
27,i didnt feel much like going
44,id made that damn date with sally though
156,   i was way early when i got there so i just sat down on one of those leather couches right near the clock in the lobby and watched the girls
171,a lot of schools were home for vacation already and there were about a million girls sitting and standing around waiting for their dates to show up
231,girls with their legs crossed girls with their legs not crossed girls with terrific legs girls with lousy legs girls that looked like swell girls girls that looked like theyd be bitches if you knew them
58,it was really nice sightseeing if you know what i mean
118,in a way it was sort of depressing too because you kept wondering what the hell would happen to all of them
52,when they got out of school and college i mean
60,you figured most of them would probably marry dopey guys
94,guys that always talk about how many miles they get to a gallon in their goddam cars
122,guys that get sore and childish as hell if you beat them at golf or even just some stupid game like pingpong
24,guys that are very mean
27,guys that never read books
62,guys that are very boringbut i have to be careful about that
43,i mean about calling certain guys bores
26,i dont understand boring guys
12,i really dont
96,when i was at elkton hills i roomed for about two months with this boy harris mackim
88,he was very intelligent and all but he was one of the biggest bores i ever met
91,he had one of these very raspy voices and he never stopped talking practically
118,he never stopped talking and what was awful was he never said anything you wanted to hear in the first place
25,but he could do one thing
65,the sonuvabitch could whistle better than anybody i ever heard
215,hed be making his bed or hanging up stuff in the closethe was always hanging up stuff in the closetit drove me crazyand hed be whistling while he did it if he wasnt talking in this raspy voice
86,he could even whistle classical stuff but most of the time he just whistled jazz
173,he could take something very jazzy like tin roof blues and whistle it so nice and easyright while he was hanging stuff up in the closetthat it could kill you
65,naturally i never told him i thought he was a terrific whistler
79,i mean you dont just go up to somebody and say youre a terrific whistler
180, but i roomed with him for about two whole months even though he bored me till i was half crazy just because he was such a terrific whistler the best i ever heard
28,so i dont know about bores
90,maybe you shouldnt feel too sorry if you see some swell girl getting married to them
106,they dont hurt anybody most of them and maybe theyre secretly all terrific whistlers or something
19,who the hell knows
80,finally old sally started coming up the stairs and i started down to meet her
19,she looked terrific
14,she really did
56,she had on this black coat and sort of a black beret
55,she hardly ever wore a hat but that beret looked nice
70,the funny part is i felt like marrying her the minute i saw her
115,i didnt even like her much and yet all of a sudden i felt like i was in love with her and wanted to marry her
25,i swear to god im crazy
24,its marvelous to see you
14,its been ages
83, she had one of these very loud embarrassing voices when you met her somewhere
114,she got away with it because she was so damn goodlooking but it always gave me a pain in the ass
26,swell to see you i said
15,i meant it too
17,how are ya anyway
22,  absolutely marvelous
74,   i told her no but she was around ten minutes late as a matter of fact
28,i didnt give a damn though
182,all that crap they have in cartoons in the saturday evening post and all showing guys on street corners looking sore as hell because their dates are latethats bunk
76,if a girl looks swell when she meets you who gives a damn if shes late
25,we better hurry i said
31,the show starts at twoforty
59, we started going down the stairs to where the taxis are
23,what are we going to see
10,i dont know
31,its all i could get tickets for
12,   the lunts
11,oh marvelous
61, i told you shed go mad when she heard it was for the lunts
74,we horsed around a little bit in the cab on the way over to the theater
148,at first she didnt want to because she had her lipstick on and all but i was being seductive as hell and she didnt have any alternative
93,twice when the goddam cab stopped short in traffic i damn near fell off the seat
75,those damn drivers never even look where theyre going i swear they dont
117,then just to show you how crazy i am when we were coming out of this big clinch i told her i loved her and all
71,it was a lie of course but the thing is i meant it when i said it
20,i swear to god i am
35,oh darling i love you too she said
90,then right in the same damn breath she said promise me youll let your hair grow
27,crew cuts are getting corny
24,and your hairs so lovely
16, lovely my ass
39,the show wasnt as bad as some ive seen
35,it was on the crappy side though
77,it was about five hundred thousand years in the life of this one old couple
124,it starts out when theyre young and all and the girls parents dont want her to marry the boy but she marries him anyway
42,then they keep getting older and older
73,the husband goes to war and the wife has this brother thats a drunkard
28,i couldnt get very interested
79,i mean i didnt care too much when anybody in the family died or anything
36,they were all just a bunch of actors
119,the husband and wife were a pretty nice old couplevery witty and allbut i couldnt get too interested in them
89,for one thing they kept drinking tea or some goddam thing all through the play
123,every time you saw them some butler was shoving some tea in front of them or the wife was pouring it for somebody
115,and everybody kept coming in and going out all the timeyou got dizzy watching people sit down and stand up
112,alfred lunt and lynn fontanne were the old couple and they were very good but i didnt like them much
47,they were different though ill say that
63,they didnt act like people and they didnt act like actors
20,its hard to explain
64,they acted more like they knew they were celebrities and all
48,i mean they were good but they were too good
106,when one of them got finished making a speech the other one said something very fast right after it
92,it was supposed to be like people really talking and interrupting each other and all
87,the trouble was it was too much like people talking and interrupting each other
81,they acted a little bit the way old ernie down in the village plays the piano
95,if you do something too good then after a while if you dont watch it you start showing off
37,and then youre not as good any more
107,but anyway they were the only ones in the showthe lunts i meanthat looked like they had any real brains
18,i have to admit it
88,at the end of the first act we went out with all the other jerks for a cigarette
20,what a deal that was
183,you never saw so many phonies in all your life everybody smoking their ears off and talking about the play so that everybody could hear and know how sharp they were
65,some dopey movie actor was standing near us having a cigarette
148,i dont know his name but he always plays the part of a guy in a war movie that gets yellow before its time to go over the top
162,he was with some gorgeous blonde and the two of them were trying to be very blas and all like as if he didnt even know people were looking at him
12,modest as hell
26,i got a big bang out of it
115,old sally didnt talk much except to rave about the lunts because she was busy rubbering and being charming
87,then all of a sudden she saw some jerk she knew on the other side of the lobby
93,some guy in one of those very dark gray flannel suits and one of those checkered vests
18,strictly ivy league
96,he was standing next to the wall smoking himself to death and looking bored as hell
58,old sally kept saying i know that boy from somewhere
76, she always knew somebody any place you took her or thought she did
155,she kept saying that till i got bored as hell and i said to her why dont you go on over and give him a big soul kiss if you know him
14,hell enjoy it
30, she got sore when i said that
69,finally though the jerk noticed her and came over and said hello
45,you shouldve seen the way they said hello
66,youd have thought they hadnt seen each other in twenty years
110,youd have thought theyd taken baths in the same bathtub or something when they were little kids
13,old buddyroos
18,it was nauseating
90,the funny part was they probably met each other just once at some phony party
81,finally when they were all done slobbering around old sally introduced us
81,his name was george somethingi dont even rememberand he went to andover
13,big big deal
71,you shouldve seen him when old sally asked him how he liked the play
103,he was the kind of a phony that have to give themselves room when they answer somebodys question
67,he stepped back and stepped right on the ladys foot behind him
44,he probably broke every toe in her body
106,he said the play itself was no masterpiece but that the lunts of course were absolute angels
14,for chrissake
14,that killed me
83,then he and old sally started talking about a lot of people they both knew
66,it was the phoniest conversation you ever heard in your life
140,they both kept thinking of places as fast as they could then theyd think of somebody that lived there and mention their name
67,i was all set to puke when it was time to go sit down again
12,i really was
91,and then when the next act was over they continued their goddam boring conversation
78,they kept thinking of more places and more names of people that lived there
117,the worst part was the jerk had one of those very phony ivy league voices one of those very tired snobby voices
27,he sounded just like a girl
56,he didnt hesitate to horn in on my date the bastard
237,i even thought for a minute that he was going to get in the goddam cab with us when the show was over because he walked about two blocks with us but he had to meet a bunch of phonies for cocktails he said
171,i could see them all sitting around in some bar with their goddam checkered vests criticizing shows and books and women in those tired snobby voices
25,they kill me those guys
130,i sort of hated old sally by the time we got in the cab after listening to that phony andover bastard for about ten hours
91,i was all set to take her home and alli really wasbut she said i have a marvelous idea
42, she was always having a marvelous idea
13,listen she said
44,what time do you have to be home for dinner
47,i mean are you in a terrible hurry or anything
41,do you have to be home any special time
23,no special time i said
32,truer word was never spoken boy
35, lets go iceskating at radio city
40,  thats the kind of ideas she always had
26,iceskating at radio city
17,you mean right now
25,   just for an hour or so
18,dont you want to
56,if you dont want to i didnt say i didnt want to i said
14,if you want to
15,   do you mean it
37,dont just say it if you dont mean it
50,i mean i dont give a darn one way or the other
19,  not much she didnt
64,you can rent those darling little skating skirts old sally said
34,jeannette cultz did it last week
34,  thats why she was so hot to go
114,she wanted to see herself in one of those little skirts that just come down over their butt and all
117,so we went and after they gave us our skates they gave sally this little blue butttwitcher of a dress to wear
48,she really did look damn good in it though
19,i save to admit it
35,and dont think she didnt know it
85,the kept walking ahead of me so that id see how cute her little ass looked
29,it did look pretty cute too
19,i have to admit it
83,the funny part was though we were the worst skaters on the whole goddam rink
16,i mean the worst
29,and there were some lulus too
81,old sallys ankles kept bending in till they were practically on the ice
81,they not only looked stupid as hell but they probably hurt like hell too
14,i know mine did
21,mine were killing me
26,we mustve looked gorgeous
205,and what made it worse there were at least a couple of hundred rubbernecks that didnt have anything better to do than stand around and watch everybody falling all over themselves
71,do you want to get a table inside and have a drink or something
24, i said to her finally
61,thats the most marvelous idea youve had all day the said
22,she was killing herself
14,it was brutal
28,i really felt sorry for her
145,we took off our goddam skates and went inside this bar where you can get drinks and watch the skaters in just your stocking feet
94,as soon as we sat down old sally took off her gloves and i gave her a cigarette
29,she wasnt looking too happy
177,the waiter came up and i ordered a coke for hershe didnt drinkand a scotch and soda for myself but the sonuvabitch wouldnt bring me one so i had a coke too
42,then i sort of started lighting matches
47,i do that quite a lot when im in a certain mood
103,i sort of let them burn down till i cant hold them any more then i drop them in the ashtray
20,its a nervous habit
71,then all of a sudden out of a clear blue sky old sally said look
15,i have to know
72,are you or arent you coming over to help me trim the tree christmas eve
12,i have to know
81, she was still being snotty on account of her ankles when she was skating
18,i wrote you i would
42,youve asked me that about twenty times
33,   i mean i have to know she said
47,she started looking all around the goddam room
96,all of a sudden i quit lighting matches and sort of leaned nearer to her over the table
36,i had quite a few topics on my mind
16,hey sally i said
64,she was looking at some girl on the other side of the room
25,did you ever get fed up
102,i mean did you ever get scared that everything was going to go lousy unless you did something
47,i mean do you like school and all that stuff
21, its a terrific bore
26,   i mean do you hate it
62,i know its a terrific bore but do you hate it is what i mean
32,  well i dont exactly hate it
34,you always have to  well i hate it
26,boy do i hate it i said
21,but it isnt just that
14,its everything
37,i hate living in new york and all
394,taxicabs and madison avenue buses with the drivers and all always yelling at you to get out at the rear door and being introduced to phony guys that call the lunts angels and going up and down in elevators when you just want to go outside and guys fitting your pants all the time at brooks and people always  dont shout please old sally said
54,which was very funny because i wasnt even shouting
17,take cars i said
37,i said it in this very quiet voice
41,take most people theyre crazy about cars
254,they worry if they get a little scratch on them and theyre always talking about how many miles they get to a gallon and if they get a brandnew car already they start thinking about trading it in for one thats even newer
26,i dont even like old cars
39,i mean they dont even interest me
29,id rather have a goddam horse
38,a horse is at least human for gods sake
92,a horse you can at least  i dont know what youre even talking about old sally said
39,you jump from one  you know something
72,youre probably the only reason im in new york right now or anywhere
68,if you werent around id probably be someplace way the hell off
35,in the woods or some goddam place
46,youre the only reason im around practically
23,  youre sweet she said
63,but you could tell she wanted me to change the damn subject
47,you ought to go to a boys school sometime
24,try it sometime i said
406,its full of phonies and all you do is study so that you can learn enough to be smart enough to be able to buy a goddam cadillac some day and you have to keep making believe you give a damn if the football team loses and all you do is talk about girls and liquor and sex all day and everybody sticks together in these dirty little goddam cliques
179,the guys that are on the basketball team stick together the catholics stick together the goddam intellectuals stick together the guys that play bridge stick together
81,even the guys that belong to the goddam bookofthemonth club stick together
76,if you try to have a little intelligent  now listen old sally said
46,lots of boys get more out of school than that
29,i agree they do some of them
31,but thats all i get out of it
14,thats my point
41,thats exactly my goddam point i said
43,i dont get hardly anything out of anything
15,im in bad shape
16,im in lousy shape
19,  you certainly are
41, then all of a sudden i got this idea
11,look i said
13,heres my idea
46,how would you like to get the hell out of here
14,heres my idea
97,i know this guy down in greenwich village that we can borrow his car for a couple of weeks
75,he used to go to the same school i did and he still owes me ten bucks
125,what we could do is tomorrow morning we could drive up to massachusetts and vermont and all around there see
45,its beautiful as hell up there it really is
120, i was getting excited as hell the more i thought of it and i sort of reached over and took old sallys goddam hand
27,what a goddam fool i was
18,no kidding i said
55,i have about a hundred and eighty bucks in the bank
100,i can take it out when it opens in the morning and then i could go down and get this guys car
83,well stay in these cabin camps and stuff like that till the dough runs out
168,then when the dough runs out i could get a job somewhere and we could live somewhere with a brook and all and later on we could get married or something
62,i could chop all our own wood in the wintertime and all
44,honest to god we could have a terrific time
10,wuddaya say
11,wuddaya say
23,will you do it with me
58, you cant just do something like that old sally said
25,she sounded sore as hell
17,why the hell not
42,   stop screaming at me please she said
54,which was crap because i wasnt even screaming at her
11,why cantcha
31,   because you cant thats all
50,in the first place were both practically children
98,and did you ever stop to think what youd do if you didnt get a job when your money ran out
19,wed starve to death
61,the whole things so fantastic it isnt even  it isnt fantastic
13,id get a job
21,dont worry about that
34,you dont have to worry about that
16,whats the matter
27,dont you want to go with me
18,say so if you dont
16,  it isnt that
37,it isnt that at all old sally said
36,i was beginning to hate her in a way
58,well have oodles of time to do those thingsall those things
81,i mean after you go to college and all and if we should get married and all
50,therell be oodles of marvelous places to go to
28,youre just  no there wouldnt be
51,there wouldnt be oodles of places to go to at all
34,itd be entirely different i said
38,i was getting depressed as hell again
14,i cant hear you
149,one minute you scream at me and the next you  i said no there wouldnt be marvelous places to go to after i went to college and all
14,open your ears
22,itd be entirely different
66,wed have to go downstairs in elevators with suitcases and stuff
92,wed have to phone up everybody and tell em goodby and send em postcards from hotels and all
289,and id be working in some office making a lot of dough and riding to work in cabs and madison avenue buses and reading newspapers and playing bridge all the time and going to the movies and seeing a lot of stupid shorts and coming attractions and newsreels
15,christ almighty
146,theres always a dumb horse race and some dame breaking a bottle over a ship and some chimpanzee riding a goddam bicycle with pants on
29,it wouldnt be the same at all
34,you dont see what i mean at all
14,  maybe i dont
39,maybe you dont either old sally said
47,we both hated each others guts by that time
83,you could see there wasnt any sense trying to have an intelligent conversation
37,i was sorry as hell id started it
34,cmon lets get outa here i said
71,you give me a royal pain in the ass if you want to know the truth
49,  boy did she hit the ceiling when i said that
110,i know i shouldntve said it and i probably wouldntve ordinarily but she was depressing the hell out of me
57,usually i never say crude things like that to girls
29,boy did she hit the ceiling
62,i apologized like a madman but she wouldnt accept my apology
20,she was even crying
135,which scared me a little bit because i was a little afraid shed go home and tell her father i called her a pain in the ass
95,her father was one of those big silent bastards and he wasnt too crazy about me anyhow
44,he once told old sally i was too goddam noisy
33,im sorry i kept telling her
11,youre sorry
10,youre sorry
26,thats very funny she said
94,she was still sort of crying and all of a sudden i did feel sort of sorry id said it
19,cmon ill take ya home
38,   i can go home by myself thank you
50,if you think id let you take me home youre mad
53,no boy ever said that to me in my entire life
134,  the whole thing was sort of funny in a way if you thought about it and all of a sudden i did something i shouldnt have
52,and i have one of these very loud stupid laughs
136,i mean if i ever sat behind myself in a movie or something id probably lean over and tell myself to please shut up
35,it made old sally madder than ever
100,i stuck around for a while apologizing and trying to get her to excuse me but she wouldnt
55,she kept telling me to go away and leave her alone
20,so finally i did it
65,i went inside and got my shoes and stuff and left without her
60,i shouldntve but i was pretty goddam fed up by that time
95,if you want to know the truth i dont even know why i started all that stuff with her
75,i mean about going away somewhere to massachusetts and vermont and all
69,i probably wouldntve taken her even if shed wanted to go with me
47,she wouldnt have been anybody to go with
67,the terrible part though is that i meant it when i asked her
25,thats the terrible part
28,i swear to god im a madman
173,   when i left the skating rink i felt sort of hungry so i went in this drugstore and had a swiss cheese sandwich and a malted and then i went in a phone booth
85,i thought maybe i might give old jane another buzz and see if she was home yet
154,i mean i had the whole evening free and i thought id give her a buzz and if she was home yet take her dancing or something somewhere
71,i never danced with her or anything the whole time i knew her
33,i saw her dancing once though
35,she looked like a very good dancer
50,it was at this fourth of july dance at the club
84,i didnt know her too well then and i didnt think i ought to cut in on her date
65,she was dating this terrible guy al pike that went to choate
88,i didnt know him too well but he was always hanging around the swimming pool
102,he wore those white lastex kind of swimming trunks and he was always going off the high dive
54,he did the same lousy old half gainer all day long
74,it was the only dive he could do but he thought he was very hot stuff
28,all muscles and no brains
39,anyway thats who jane dated that night
25,i couldnt understand it
18,i swear i couldnt
112,after we started going around together i asked her how come she could date a showoff bastard like al pike
30,jane said he wasnt a showoff
40,she said he had an inferiority complex
90,she acted like she felt sorry for him or something and she wasnt just putting it on
13,she meant it
29,its a funny thing about girls
185,every time you mention some guy thats strictly a bastardvery mean or very conceited and alland when you mention it to the girl shell tell you he has an inferiority complex
83,maybe he has but that still doesnt keep him from being a bastard in my opinion
43,you never know what theyre going to think
79,i once got this girl roberta walshs roommate a date with a friend of mine
74,his name was bob robinson and he really had an inferiority complex
157,you could tell he was very ashamed of his parents and all because they said he dont and she dont and stuff like that and they werent very wealthy
36,but he wasnt a bastard or anything
23,he was a very nice guy
56,but this roberta walshs roommate didnt like him at all
188,she told roberta he was too conceitedand the reason she thought he was conceited was because he happened to mention to her that he was captain of the debating team
62,a little thing like that and she thought he was conceited
282,the trouble with girls is if they like a boy no matter how big a bastard he is theyll say he has an inferiority complex and if they dont like him no matter how nice a guy he is or how big an inferiority complex he has theyll say hes conceited
23,even smart girls do it
90,anyway i gave old jane a buzz again but her phone didnt answer so i had to hang up
108,then i had to look through my address book to see who the hell might be available for the evening
81,the trouble was though my address book only has about three people in it
99,jane and this man mr antolini that was my teacher at elkton hills and my fathers office number
44,i keep forgetting to put peoples names in
49,so what i did finally i gave old carl luce a buzz
53,he graduated from the whooton school after i left
146,he was about three years older than i was and i didnt like him too much but he was one of these very intellectual guys he had the highest iq
140,of any boy at whootonand i thought he might want to have dinner with me somewhere and have a slightly intellectual conversation
34,he was very enlightening sometimes
20,so i gave him a buzz
87,he went to columbia now but he lived on th street and all and i knew hed be home
171,when i got him on the phone he said he couldnt make it for dinner but that hed meet me for a drink at ten oclock at the wicker bar on th
53,i think he was pretty surprised to hear from me
34,i once called him a fatassed phony
108,i had quite a bit of time to kill till ten oclock so what i did i went to the movies at radio city
105,it was probably the worst thing i couldve done but it was near and i couldnt think of anything else
47,i came in when the goddam stage show was on
134,the rockettes were kicking their heads off the way they do when theyre all in line with their arms around each others waist
111,the audience applauded like mad and some guy behind me kept saying to his wife you know what that is
16,thats precision
13, he killed me
174,then after the rockettes a guy came out in a tuxedo and roller skates on and started skating under a bunch of little tables and telling jokes while he did it
159,he was a very good skater and all but i couldnt enjoy it much because i kept picturing him practicing to be a guy that rollerskates on the stage
20,it seemed so stupid
39,i guess i just wasnt in the right mood
87,then after him they had this christmas thing they have at radio city every year
221,all these angels start coming out of the boxes and everywhere guys carrying crucifixes and stuff all over the place and the whole bunch of themthousands of themsinging come all ye faithful
222,its supposed to be religious as hell i know and very pretty and all but i cant see anything religious or pretty for gods sake about a bunch of actors carrying crucifixes all over the stage
152,when they were all finished and started going out the boxes again you could tell they could hardly wait to get a cigarette or something
127,i saw it with old sally hayes the year before and she kept saying how beautiful it was the costumes and all
94,i said old jesus probably wouldve puked if he could see itall those fancy costumes and all
43,sally said i was a sacrilegious atheist
12,i probably am
109,the thing jesus really wouldve liked would be the guy that plays the kettle drums in the orchestra
59,ive watched that guy since i was about eight years old
140,my brother allie and i if we were with our parents and all we used to move our seats and go way down so we could watch him
33,hes the best drummer i ever saw
126,he only gets a chance to bang them a couple of times during a whole piece but he never looks bored when he isnt doing it
104,then when he does bang them he does it so nice and sweet with this nervous expression on his face
121,one time when we went to washington with my father allie sent him a postcard but ill bet he never got it
37,we werent too sure how to address it
70,after the christmas thing was over the goddam picture started
45,it was so putrid i couldnt take my eyes off it
118,it was about this english guy alec something that was in the war and loses his memory in the hospital and all
131,he comes out of the hospital carrying a cane and limping all over the place all over london not knowing who the hell he is
41,hes really a duke but he doesnt know it
65,then he meets this nice homey sincere girl getting on a bus
133,her goddam hat blows off and he catches it and then they go upstairs and sit down and start talking about charles dickens
41,hes both their favorite author and all
54,hes carrying this copy of oliver twist and sos she
14,i couldve puked
161,anyway they fell in love right away on account of theyre both so nuts about charles dickens and all and he helps her run her publishing business
23,shes a publisher the girl
95,only shes not doing so hot because her brothers a drunkard and he spends all their dough
208,hes a very bitter guy the brother because he was a doctor in the war and now he cant operate any more because his nerves are shot so he boozes all the time but hes pretty witty and all
113,anyway old alec writes a book and this girl publishes it and they both make a hatful of dough on it
75,theyre all set to get married when this other girl old marcia shows up
120,marcia was alecs fiance before he lost his memory and she recognizes him when hes in this store autographing books
151,she tells old alec hes really a duke and all but he doesnt believe her and doesnt want to go with her to visit his mother and all
25,his mothers blind as a bat
44,but the other girl the homey one makes him go
23,shes very noble and all
232,but he still doesnt get his memory back even when his great dane jumps all over him and his mother sticks her fingers all over his face and brings him this teddy bear he used to slobber around with when he was a kid
120,but then one day some kids are playing cricket on the lawn and he gets smacked in the head with a cricket ball
112,then right away he gets his goddam memory back and he goes in and kisses his mother on the forehead and all
128,then he starts being a regular duke again and he forgets all about the homey babe that has the publishing business
63,id tell you the rest of the story but i might puke if i did
44,it isnt that id spoil it for you or anything
44,there isnt anything to spoil for chrissake
255,anyway it ends up with alec and the homey babe getting married and the brother thats a drunkard gets his nerves back and operates on alecs mother so she can see again and then the drunken brother and old marcia go for each other
160,it ends up with everybody at this long dinner table laughing their asses off because the great dane comes in with a bunch of puppies
67,everybody thought it was a male i suppose or some goddam thing
79,all i can say is dont see it if you dont want to puke all over yourself
115,the part that got me was there was a lady sitting next to me that cried all through the goddam picture
38,the phonier it got the more she cried
123,youd have thought she did it because she was kindhearted as hell but i was sitting right next to her and she wasnt
125,she had this little kid with her that was bored as hell and had to go to the bathroom but she wouldnt take him
55,she kept telling him to sit still and behave himself
51,she was about as kindhearted as a goddam wolf
155,you take somebody that cries their goddam eyes out over phony stuff in the movies and nine times out of ten theyre mean bastards at heart
14,im not kidding
180,after the movie was over i started walking down to the wicker bar where i was supposed to meet old carl luce and while i walked i sort of thought about war and all
39,those war movies always do that to me
52,i dont think i could stand it if i had to go to war
17,i really couldnt
145,it wouldnt be too bad if theyd just take you out and shoot you or something but you have to stay in the army so goddam long
26,thats the whole trouble
14,my brother db
40,was in the army for four goddam years
104,he was in the war toohe landed on dday and allbut i really think he hated the army worse than the war
150,i was practically a child at the time but i remember when he used to come home on furlough and all all he did was lie on his bed practically
45,he hardly ever even came in the living room
144,later when he went overseas and was in the war and all he didnt get wounded or anything and he didnt have to shoot anybody
89,all he had to do was drive some cowboy general around all day in a command car
111,he once told allie and i that if hed had to shoot anybody he wouldntve known which direction to shoot in
76,he said the army was practically as full of bastards as the nazis were
156,i remember allie once asked him wasnt it sort of good that he was in the war because he was a writer and it gave him a lot to write about and all
132,he made allie go get his baseball mitt and then he asked him who was the best war poet rupert brooke or emily dickinson
27,allie said emily dickinson
276,i dont know too much about it myself because i dont read much poetry but i do know itd drive me crazy if i had to be in the army and be with a bunch of guys like ackley and stradlater and old maurice all the time marching with them and all
132,i was in the boy scouts once for about a week and i couldnt even stand looking at the back of the guys neck in front of me
77,they kept telling you to look at the back of the guys neck in front of you
109,i swear if theres ever another war they better just take me out and stick me in front of a firing squad
17,i wouldnt object
134,what gets me about db though he hated the war so much and yet he got me to read this book a farewell to arms last summer
26,he said it was so terrific
29,thats what i cant understand
93,it had this guy in it named lieutenant henry that was supposed to be a nice guy and all
18,i dont see how db
86,could hate the army and war and all so much and still like a phony like that
183,i mean for instance i dont see how he could like a phony book like that and still like that one by ring lardner or that other one hes so crazy about the great gatsby
104,got sore when i said that and said i was too young and all to appreciate it but i dont think so
66,i told him i liked ring lardner and the great gatsby and all
38,i was crazy about the great gatsby
14,that killed me
60,anyway im sort of glad theyve got the atomic bomb invented
79,if theres ever another war im going to sit right the hell on top of it
48,ill volunteer for it i swear to god i will
110,   in case you dont live in new york the wicker bar is in this sort of swanky hotel the seton hotel
55,i used to go there quite a lot but i dont any more
21,i gradually cut it out
128,its one of those places that are supposed to be very sophisticated and all and the phonies are coming in the window
135,they used to have these two french babes tina and janine come out and play the piano and sing about three times every night
131,one of them played the pianostrictly lousyand the other one sang and most of the songs were either pretty dirty or in french
101,the one that sang old janine was always whispering into the goddam microphone before she sang
73,shed say and now we like to geeve you our impression of vooly voo fransay
166,eet ees the story of a leetle fransh girl who comes to a beeg ceety just like new york and falls een love wees a leetle boy from brookleen
21,we hope you like eet
193, then when she was all done whispering and being cute as hell shed sing some dopey song half in english and half in french and drive all the phonies in the place mad with joy
147,if you sat around there long enough and heard all the phonies applauding and all you got to hate everybody in the world i swear you did
33,the bartender was a louse too
16,he was a big snob
106,he didnt talk to you at all hardly unless you were a big shot or a celebrity or something
96,if you were a big shot or a celebrity or something then he was even more nauseating
112,hed go up to you and say with this big charming smile like he was a helluva swell guy if you knew him well
15,hows connecticut
17, or hows florida
41, it was a terrible place im not kidding
42,i cut out going there entirely gradually
39,it was pretty early when i got there
122,i sat down at the barit was pretty crowdedand had a couple of scotch and sodas before old luce even showed up
126,i stood up when i ordered them so they could see how tall i was and all and not think i was a goddam minor
42,then i watched the phonies for a while
71,some guy next to me was snowing hell out of the babe he was with
44,he kept telling her she had aristocratic hands
14,that killed me
42,the other end of the bar was full of flits
135,they werent too flittylookingi mean they didnt have their hair too long or anythingbut you could tell they were flits anyway
28,finally old luce showed up
76,he was supposed to be my student adviser when i was at whooton
134,the only thing he ever did though was give these sex talks and all late at night when there was a bunch of guys in his room
62,he knew quite a bit about sex especially perverts and all
202,he was always telling us about a lot of creepy guys that go around having affairs with sheep and guys that go around with girls pants sewed in the lining of their hats and all
22,and flits and lesbians
76,old luce knew who every flit and lesbian in the united states was
102,all you had to do was mention somebodyanybodyand old luced tell you if he was a flit or not
123,sometimes it was hard to believe the people he said were flits and lesbians and all movie actors and like that
73,some of the ones he said were flits were even married for gods sake
52,youd keep saying to him you mean joe blows a flit
74,that big tough guy that plays gangsters and cowboys all the time
24, old luced say certainly
33, he was always saying certainly
58, he said it didnt matter if a guy was married or not
85,he said half the married guys in the world were flits and didnt even know it
93,he said you could turn into one practically overnight if you had all the traits and all
31,he used to scare the hell out of us
48,i kept waiting to turn into a flit or something
95,the funny thing about old luce i used to think he was sort of flitty himself in a way
137,he was always saying try this for size and then hed goose the hell out of you while you were going down the corridor
152,and whenever he went to the can he always left the goddam door open and talked to you while you were brushing your teeth or something
28,that stuffs sort of flitty
12,it really is
156,ive known quite a few real flits at schools and all and theyre always doing stuff like that and thats why i always had my doubts about old luce
41,he was a pretty intelligent guy though
13,he really was
47,he never said hello or anything when he met you
96,the first thing he said when he sat down was that he could only stay a couple of minutes
23,he said he had a date
27,then he ordered a dry martini
57,he told the bartender to make it very dry and no olive
35,hey i got a flit for you i told him
22,at the end of the bar
14,dont look now
26,i been saving him for ya
19, very funny he said
20,same old caulfield
32,when are you going to grow up
19,   i bored him a lot
12,i really did
19,he amused me though
54,he was one of those guys that sort of amuse me a lot
18,hows your sex life
12, i asked him
40,he hated you to ask him stuff like that
14,relax he said
41,just sit back and relax for chrissake
20,   im relaxed i said
13,hows columbia
23,  certainly i like it
58,if i didnt like it i wouldnt have gone there he said
46,he could be pretty boring himself sometimes
23,whatre you majoring in
12, i asked him
27, i was only horsing around
25,whatre you trying to befunny
23,im only kidding i said
15,listen hey luce
36,youre one of these intellectual guys
19,i need your advice
51,im in a terrific  he let out this big groan on me
17,listen caulfield
120,if you want to sit here and have a quiet peaceful drink and a quiet peaceful conver  all right all right i said
78, you could tell he didnt feel like discussing anything serious with me
53,thats the trouble with these intellectual guys
69,they never want to discuss anything serious unless they feel like it
70,so all i did was i started discussing topics in general with him
31,no kidding hows your sex life
13, i asked him
69,you still going around with that same babe you used to at whooton
48,the one with the terrffic good god no he said
19,what happened to her
27,  i havent the faintest idea
90,for all i know since you ask shes probably the whore of new hampshire by this time
17,  that isnt nice
149,if she was decent enough to let you get sexy with her all the time you at least shouldnt talk about her that way
14, old luce said
61,is this going to be a typical caulfield conversation
23,i want to know right now
36,  no i said but it isnt nice anyway
93,if she was decent and nice enough to let you must we pursue this horrible trend of thought
23,   i didnt say anything
71,i was sort of afraid hed get up and leave on me if i didnt shut up
44,so all i did was i ordered another drink
35,i felt like getting stinking drunk
33,whore you going around with now
11, i asked him
24,you feel like telling me
13, nobody you know
15,  yeah but who
19,i might know her
28,  girl lives in the village
17,if you must know
14,how old is she
35, ive never asked her for gods sake
23,  well around how old
68,   i should imagine shes in her late thirties old luce said
22,in her late thirties
12,you like that
12, i asked him
21,you like em that old
87, the reason i was asking was because he really knew quite a bit about sex and all
45,he was one of the few guys i knew that did
67,he lost his virginity when he was only fourteen in nantucket
13,he really did
47,i like a mature person if thats what you mean
41,no kidding they better for sex and all
27,lets get one thing straight
63,i refuse to answer any typical caulfield questions tonight
41,when in hell are you going to grow up
34,  i didnt say anything for a while
29,i let it drop for a while
89,then old luce ordered another martini and told the bartender to make it a lot dryer
61,how long you been going around with her this sculpture babe
11, i asked him
20,i was really interested
45,did you know her when you were at whooton
51,she just arrived in this country a few months ago
16,wheres she from
35,   she happens to be from shanghai
11, no kidding
26,she chinese for chrissake
10,  obviously
12,  no kidding
17,do you like that
17,her being chinese
12,   obviously
40,id be interested to knowi really would
81,   i simply happen to find eastern philosophy more satisfactory than western
13,since you ask
25,wuddaya mean philosophy
20,ya mean sex and all
30,you mean its better in china
19,that what you mean
43,  not necessarily in china for gods sake
15,the east i said
43,must we go on with this inane conversation
26, listen im serious i said
28,whys it better in the east
59,   its too involved to go into for gods sake old luce said
84,they simply happen to regard sex as both a physical and a spiritual experience
27,if you think im  so do i
89,so do i regard it as a wuddayacallita physical and spiritual experience and all
11,i really do
53,but it depends on who the hell im doing it with
81,if im doing it with somebody i dont even  not so loud for gods sake caulfield
99,if you cant manage to keep your voice down lets drop the whole  all right but listen i said
63,i was getting excited and i was talking a little too loud
53,sometimes i talk a little loud when i get excited
34,this is what i mean though i said
78,i know its supposed to be physical and spiritual and artistic and all
116,but what i mean is you cant do it with everybodyevery girl you neck  with and alland make it come out that way
28, lets drop it old luce said
11,do you mind
24,   all right but listen
32,take you and this chinese babe
27,whats so good about you two
16, drop it i said
36,  i was getting a little too personal
16,i realize that
56,but that was one of the annoying  things about luce
170,when we were at whooton hed make you describe the most personal stuff that happened to you but if you started asking him questions about himself he got sore
134,these intellectual guys dont like to have an intellectual conversation with you unless theyre running the whole thing
110,they always want you to shut up when they shut up and go back to your room when they go back to their room
230,when i was at whooton old luce used to hate ityou really could tell he didwhen after he was finished giving his sex talk to a bunch of us in his room we stuck around and chewed the fat by ourselves for a while
33,i mean the other guys and myself
22,in somebody elses room
19,old luce hated that
122,he always wanted everybody to go back to their own room and shut up when he was finished being the big shot
86,the thing he was afraid of he was afraid somebodyd say something smarter than he had
19,he really amused me
21,maybe ill go to china
28,my sex life is lousy i said
21,your mind is immature
14,it really is
16,i know it i said
39,you know what the trouble with me is
83,i can never get really sexyi mean really sexywith a girl i dont like a lot
33,i mean i have to like her a lot
59,if i dont i sort of lose my goddam desire for her and all
54,boy it really screws up my sex life something awful
20,my sex life stinks
32,  naturally it does for gods sake
51,i told you the last time i saw you what you need
44,  you mean to go to a psychoanalyst and all
40,thats what hed told me i ought to do
39,his father was a psychoanalyst and all
29,its up to you for gods sake
64,its none of my goddam business what you do with your life
33, i didnt say anything for a while
13,i was thinking
83,supposing i went to your father and had him psychoanalyze me and all i said
23,what would he do to me
29,i mean what would he do to me
39,  he wouldnt do a goddam thing to you
61,hed simply talk to you and youd talk to him for gods sake
68,for one thing hed help you to recognize the patterns of your mind
27,  the patterns of your mind
23,your mind runs in listen
54,im not giving an elementary course in psychoanalysis
61,if youre interested call him up and make an appointment
17,if youre not dont
25,i couldnt care less frankly
33,  i put my hand on his shoulder
16,boy he amused me
44,youre a real friendly bastard i told him
13,you know that
39,  he was looking at his wrist watch
37,i have to tear he said and stood up
15,nice seeing you
60, he got the bartender and told him to bring him his check
33,hey i said just before he beat it
38,did your father ever psychoanalyze you
11,why do you ask
12,  no reason
13,did he though
13,   not exactly
106,hes helped me to adjust myself to a certain extent but an extensive analysis hasnt been necessary
13,why do you ask
24,i was just wondering
21,take it easy he said
62,he was leaving his tip and all and he was starting to go
38,have just one more drink i told him
18,im lonesome as hell
34, he said he couldnt do it though
45,he said he was late now and then he left
77,he was strictly a pain in the ass but he certainly had a good vocabulary
74,he had the largest vocabulary of any boy at whooton when i was there
23,they gave us a test
139,  i kept sitting there getting drunk and waiting for old tina and janine to come out  and do their stuff but they werent there
120,a flittylooking guy with wavy hair came out and played the piano and then this new babe valencia came out and sang
104,she wasnt any good but she was better than old tina and janine and at least she sang good songs
131,the piano was right next to the bar where i was sitting and all and old valencia was standing practically right next to me
75,i sort of gave her the old eye but she pretended she didnt even see me
66,i probably wouldnt have done it but i was getting drunk as hell
168,when she was finished she beat it out of the room so fast i didnt even get a chance to invite her to join me for a drink so i called the headwaiter over
68,i told him to ask old valencia if shed care to join me for a drink
68,he said he would but he probably didnt even give her my message
47,people never give your message to anybody
88,boy i sat at that goddam bar till around one oclock or so getting drunk as a bastard
28,i could hardly see straight
87,the one thing i did though i was careful as hell not to get boisterous or anything
69,i didnt want anybody to notice me or anything or ask how old i was
37,but boy i could hardly see straight
99,when i was really drunk i started that stupid business with the bullet in my guts again
60,i was the only guy at the bar with a bullet in their guts
121,i kept putting my hand under my jacket on my stomach and all to keep the blood from dripping all over the place
49,i didnt want anybody to know i was even wounded
62,i was concealing the fact that i was a wounded sonuvabitch
90,finally what i felt like i felt like giving old jane a buzz and see if she was home yet
28,so i paid my check and all
62,then i left the bar and went out where the telephones were
74,i kept keeping my hand under my jacket to keep the blood from dripping
17,boy was i drunk
107,but when i got inside this phone booth i wasnt much in the mood any more to give old jane a buzz
23,i was too drunk i guess
42,so what i did i gave old sally hayes a buzz
69,i had to dial about twenty numbers before i got the right one
16,boy was i blind
54,hello i said when somebody answered the goddam phone
35,i sort of yelled it i was so drunk
12,who is this
33, this very cold ladys voice said
16,holden caulfield

14,ya want me to
21,go home and go to bed
23,     she hung up on me
17,gnight sally baby
32,sally sweetheart darling i said
34,can you imagine how drunk i was
16,i hung up too then
49,i figured she probably just came home from a date
80,i pictured her out with the lunts and all somewhere and that andover jerk
143,all of them swimming around in a goddam pot of tea and saying sophisticated stuff to each other and being charming and phony
43,i wished to god i hadnt even phoned her
26,when im drunk im a madman
52,i stayed in the damn phone booth for quite a while
68,i kept holding onto the phone sort of so i wouldnt pass out
55,i wasnt feeling too marvelous to tell you the truth
145,finally though i came out and went in the mens room staggering around like a moron and filled one of the washbowls with cold water
49,then i dunked my head in it right up to the ears
45,i didnt even bother to dry it or anything
35,i just let the sonuvabitch drip
82,then i walked over to this radiator by the window and sat down on it
21,it was nice and warm
54,it felt good because i was shivering like a bastard
62,its a funny thing i always shiver like hell when im drunk
131,i didnt have anything else to do so i kept sitting on the radiator and counting these little white squares on the floor
19,i was getting soaked
128,about a gallon of water was dripping down my neck getting all over my collar and tie and all but i didnt give a damn
31,i was too drunk to give a damn
145,then pretty soon the guy that played the piano for old valencia this very wavyhaired flittylooking guy came in to comb his golden locks
116,we sort of struck up a conversation while he was combing it except that he wasnt too goddam friendly
64,you gonna see that valencia babe when you go back in the bar
12, i asked him
29,its highly probable he said
11,witty bastard
35,all i ever meet is witty bastards
24,give her my compliments
60,ask her if that goddam waiter gave her my message willya
26, why dont you go home mac
25,how old are you anyway
12,   eightysix
22,give her my compliments
27, why dont you go home mac
37,boy you can play that goddam piano
11, i told him
25,i was just flattering him
62,he played the piano stinking if you want to know the truth
35,you oughta go on the radio i said
24,handsome chap like you
30,all those goddam golden locks
17,ya need a manager
29, go home mac like a good guy
24,go home and hit the sack
20,   no home to go to
30,no kiddingyou need a manager
22,  he didnt answer me
17,he just went out
79,he was all through combing his hair and patting it and all so he left
16,like stradlater
38,all these handsome guys are the same
67,when theyre done combing their goddam hair they beat it on you
101,when i finally got down off the radiator and went out to the hatcheck room i was crying and all
26,i dont know why but i was
76,i guess it was because i was feeling so damn depressed and lonesome
70,then when i went out to the checkroom i couldnt find my goddam check
53,the hatcheck girl was very nice about it though
27,she gave me my coat anyway
71,and my little shirley beans recordi still had it with me and all
66,i gave her a buck for being so nice but she wouldnt take it
47,she kept telling me to go home and go to bed
102,i sort of tried to make a date with her for when she got through working but she wouldnt do it
54,she said she was old enough to be my mother and all
104,i showed her my goddam gray hair and told her i was fortytwoi was only horsing around naturally
19,she was nice though
57,i showed her my goddam red hunting hat and she liked it
78,she made me put it on before i went out because my hair was still pretty wet
17,she was all right
145,i didnt feel too drunk any more when i went outside but it was getting very cold out again and my teeth started chattering like hell
26,i couldnt make them stop
197,i walked over to madison avenue and started to wait around for a bus because i didnt have hardly any money left and i had to start economizing on cabs and all
46,but i didnt feel like getting on a damn bus
62,and besides i didnt even know where i was supposed to go
53,so what i did i started walking over to the park
183,i figured id go by that little lake and see what the hell the ducks were doing see if they were around or not i still didnt know if they were around or not
148,it wasnt far over to the park and i didnt have anyplace else special to go toi didnt even know where i was going to sleep yetso i went
25,i wasnt tired or anything
25,i just felt blue as hell
65,then something terrible happened just as i got in the park
29,i dropped old phoebes record
35,it brokeinto about fifty pieces
59,it was in a big envelope and all but it broke anyway
150,i damn near cried it made me feel so terrible but all i did was i took the pieces out of the envelope and put them in my coat pocket
93,they  werent any good for anything but i didnt feel like  just throwing them away
23,then i went in the park
12,boy was it dark
258,ive lived in new york all my life and i know central park like the back of my hand because i used to rollerskate there all the time and ride my bike when i was a kid but i had the most terrific trouble finding that lagoon that night
108,i knew right where it wasit was right near central park south and allbut i still couldnt find it
37,i mustve been drunker than i thought
99,i kept walking and walking and it kept getting darker and darker and spookier and spookier
60,i didnt see one person the whole time i was in the park
15,im just as glad
50,i probably wouldve jumped about a mile if i had
25,then finally i found it
59,what it was it was partly frozen and partly not frozen
32,but i didnt see any ducks around
110,i walked all around the whole damn lakei damn near fell in once in factbut i didnt see a single duck
132,i thought maybe if there were any around they might be asleep or something near the edge of the water near the grass and all
26,thats how i nearly fell in
21,but i couldnt find any
68,finally i sat down on this bench where it wasnt so goddam dark
158,boy i was still shivering like a bastard and the back of my hair even though i had my hunting hat on was sort of full of little hunks of ice
15,that worried me
46,i thought probably id get pneumonia and die
76,i started picturing millions of jerks coming to my funeral and all
