34,to kill a mockingbird by harper lee
119,dedication for mr lee and alice in consideration of love affection lawyers i suppose were children once
108,charles lamb chapter  when he was nearly thirteen my brother jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow
142,when it healed and jems fears of never being able to play football were assuaged he was seldom selfconscious about his injury
184,his left arm was somewhat shorter than his right when he stood or walked the back of his hand was at right angles to his body his thumb parallel to his thigh
65,he couldnt have cared less so long as he could pass and punt
130,when enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident
126,i maintain that the ewells started it all but jem who was four years my senior said it started long before that
120,he said it began the summer dill came to us when dill first gave us the idea of making boo radley come out
91,i said if he wanted to take a broad view of the thing it really began with andrew jackson
156,if general jackson hadnt run the creeks up the creek simon finch would never have paddled up the alabama and where would we be if he hadnt
89,we were far too old to settle an argument with a fistfight so we consulted atticus
38,our father said we were both right
161,being southerners it was a source of shame to some members of the family that we had no recorded ancestors on either side of the battle of hastings
126,all we had was simon finch a furtrapping apothecary from cornwall whose piety was exceeded only by his stinginess
329,in england simon was irritated by the persecution of those who called themselves methodists at the hands of their more liberal brethren and as simon called himself a methodist he worked his way across the atlantic to philadelphia thence to jamaica thence to mobile and up the saint stephens
299,mindful of john wesleys strictures on the use of many words in buying and selling simon made a pile practicing medicine but in this pursuit he was unhappy lest he be tempted into doing what he knew was not for the glory of god as the putting on of gold and costly apparel
258,so simon having forgotten his teachers dictum on the possession of human chattels bought three slaves and with their aid established a homestead on the banks of the alabama river some forty miles above saint stephens
125,he returned to saint stephens only once to find a wife and with her established a line that ran high to daughters
47,simon lived to an impressive age and died rich
134,it was customary for the men in the family to remain on simons homestead finchs landing and make their living from cotton
259,the place was selfsufficient modest in comparison with the empires around it the landing nevertheless produced everything required to sustain life except ice wheat flour and articles of clothing supplied by riverboats from mobile
413,simon would have regarded with impotent fury the disturbance between the north and the south as it left his descendants stripped of everything but their land yet the tradition of living on the land remained unbroken until well into the twentieth century when my father atticus finch went to montgomery to read law and his younger brother went to boston to study medicine
215,their sister alexandra was the finch who remained at the landing she married a taciturn man who spent most of his time lying in a hammock by the river wondering if his trotlines were full
91,when my father was admitted to the bar he returned to maycomb and began his practice
92,maycomb some twenty miles east of finchs landing was the county seat of maycomb county
148,atticuss office in the courthouse contained little more than a hat rack a spittoon a checkerboard and an unsullied code of alabama
90,his first two clients were the last two persons hanged in the maycomb county jail
247,atticus had urged them to accept the states generosity in allowing them to plead guilty to seconddegree murder and escape with their lives but they were haverfords in maycomb county a name synonymous with jackass
311,the haverfords had dispatched maycomb s leading blacksmith in a misunderstanding arising from the alleged wrongful detention of a mare were imprudent enough to do it in the presence of three witnesses and insisted that thesonofabitchhadit comingtohim was a good enough defense for anybody
316,they persisted in pleading not guilty to firstdegree murder so there was nothing much atticus could do for his clients except be present at their departure an occasion that was probably the beginning of my fathers profound distaste for the practice of criminal law
186,during his first five years in maycomb atticus practiced economy more than anything for several years thereafter he invested his earnings in his brothers education
239,john hale finch was ten years younger than my father and chose to study medicine at a time when cotton was not worth growing but after getting uncle jack started atticus derived a reasonable income from the law
235,he liked maycomb he was maycomb county born and bred he knew his people they knew him and because of simon finchs industry atticus was related by blood or marriage to nearly every family in the town
79,maycomb was an old town but it was a tired old town when i first knew it
118,in rainy weather the streets turned to red slop grass grew on the sidewalks the courthouse sagged in the square
186,somehow it was hotter then a black dog suffered on a summers day bony mules hitched to hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square
52,mens stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning
158,ladies bathed before noon after their threeoclock naps and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum
24,people moved slowly then
116,they ambled across the square shuffled in and out of the stores around it took their time about everything
52,a day was twentyfour hours long but seemed longer
162,there was no hurry for there was nowhere to go nothing to buy and no money to buy it with nothing to see outside the boundaries of maycomb county
155,but it was a time of vague optimism for some of the people maycomb county had recently been told that it had nothing to fear but fear itself
98,we lived on the main residential street in town  atticus jem and i plus calpurnia our cook
117,jem and i found our father satisfactory he played with us read to us and treated us with courteous detachment
37,calpurnia was something else again
121,she was all angles and bones she was nearsighted she squinted her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard
193,she was always ordering me out of the kitchen asking me why i couldnt behave as well as jem when she knew he was older and calling me home when i wasnt ready to come
35,our battles were epic and onesided
66,calpurnia always won mainly because atticus always took her side
126,she had been with us ever since jem was born and i had felt her tyrannical presence as long as i could remember
64,our mother died when i was two so i never felt her absence
111,she was a graham from montgomery atticus met her when he was first elected to the state legislature
55,he was middleaged then she was fifteen years his junior
162,jem was the product of their first year of marriage four years later i was born and two years later our mother died from a sudden heart attack
30,they said it ran in her family
40,i did not miss her but i think jem did
160,he remembered her clearly and sometimes in the middle of a game he would sigh at length then go off and play by himself behind the carhouse
56,when he was like that i knew better than to bother him
250,when i was almost six and jem was nearly ten our summertime boundaries within calling distance of calpurnia were mrs henry lafayette duboses house two doors to the north of us and the radley place three doors to the south
36,we were never tempted to break them
168,the radley place was inhabited by an unknown entity the mere description of whom was enough to make us behave for days on end mrs dubose was plain hell
37,that was the summer dill came to us
156,early one morning as we were beginning our days play in the back yard jem and i heard something next door in miss rachel haverfords collard patch
155,we went to the wire fence to see if there was a puppy  miss rachels rat terrier was expecting  instead we found someone sitting looking at us
54,sitting down he wasnt much higher than the collards
36,we stared at him until he spoke hey
37, hey yourself said jem pleasantly
35,im charles baker harris he said
43,i just thought youd like to know i can read
87,you got anything needs readin i can do it how old are you asked jem fourandahalf
14, goin on seven
60, shoot no wonder then said jem jerking his thumb at me
99,scout yonders been readin ever since she was born and she aint even started to school yet
40,you look right puny for goin on seven
32, im little but im old he said
48,jem brushed his hair back to get a better look
45,why dont you come over charles baker harris
16,lord what a name
25, s not any funniern yours
51,aunt rachel says your names jeremy atticus finch
11, jem scowled
38,im big enough to fit mine he said
26,your names longer n you are
23,bet its a foot longer
62, folks call me dill said dill struggling under the fence
57,do better if you go over it instead of under it i said
22,where d you come from
164, dill was from meridian mississippi was spending the summer with his aunt miss rachel and would be spending every summer in maycomb from now on
184,his family was from maycomb county originally his mother worked for a photographer in meridian had entered his picture in a beautiful child contest and won five dollars
85,she gave the money to dill who went to the picture show twenty times on it
102,dont have any picture shows here except jesus ones in the courthouse sometimes said jem
22,ever see anything good
103, dill had seen dracula a revelation that moved jem to eye him with the beginning of respect
22,tell it to us he said
22,dill was a curiosity
187,he wore blue linen shorts that buttoned to his shirt his hair was snow white and stuck to his head like duckfluff he was a year my senior but i towered over him
178,as he told us the old tale his blue eyes would lighten and darken his laugh was sudden and happy he habitually pulled at a cowlick in the center of his forehead
168,when dill reduced dracula to dust and jem said the show sounded better than the book i asked dill where his father was you aint said anything about him
16, i havent got one
8, is he dead
52, no then if hes not dead youve got one havent you
108, dill blushed and jem told me to hush a sure sign that dill had been studied and found acceptable
56,thereafter the summer passed in routine contentment
261,routine contentment was improving our treehouse that rested between giant twin chinaberry trees in the back yard fussing running through our list of dramas based on the works of oliver optic victor appleton and edgar rice burroughs
41,in this matter we were lucky to have dill
136,he played the character parts formerly thrust upon me  the ape in tarzan mr crabtree in the rover boys mr damon in tom swift
127,thus we came to know dill as a pocket merlin whose head teemed with eccentric plans strange longings and quaint fancies
171,but by the end of august our repertoire was vapid from countless reproductions and it was then that dill gave us the idea of making boo radley come out
37,the radley place fascinated dill
201,in spite of our warnings and explanations it drew him as the moon draws water but drew him no nearer than the lightpole on the corner a safe distance from the radley gate
80,there he would stand his arm around the fat pole staring and wondering
61,the radley place jutted into a sharp curve beyond our house
81,walking south one faced its porch the sidewalk turned and ran beside the lot
160,the house was low was once white with a deep front porch and green shutters but had long ago darkened to the color of the slategray yard around it
86,rainrotted shingles drooped over the eaves of the veranda oak trees kept the sun away
165,the remains of a picket drunkenly guarded the front yard  a swept yard that was never swept  where johnson grass and rabbittobacco grew in abundance
46,inside the house lived a malevolent phantom
59,people said he existed but jem and i had never seen him
87,people said he went out at night when the moon was down and peeped in windows
88,when peoples azaleas froze in a cold snap it was because he had breathed on them
66,any stealthy small crimes committed in maycomb were his work
340,once the town was terrorized by a series of morbid nocturnal events peoples chickens and household pets were found mutilated although the culprit was crazy addie who eventually drowned himself in barkers eddy people still looked at the radley place unwilling to discard their initial suspicions
128,a negro would not pass the radley place at night he would cut across to the sidewalk opposite and whistle as he walked
242,the maycomb school grounds adjoined the back of the radley lot from the radley chickenyard tall pecan trees shook their fruit into the schoolyard but the nuts lay untouched by the children radley pecans would kill you
86,a baseball hit into the radley yard was a lost ball and no questions asked
73,the misery of that house began many years before jem and i were born
99,the radleys welcome anywhere in town kept to themselves a predilection unforgivable in maycomb
255,they did not go to church maycombs principal recreation but worshiped at home mrs radley seldom if ever crossed the street for a midmorning coffee break with her neighbors and certainly never joined a missionary circle
210,mr radley walked to town at eleventhirty every morning and came back promptly at twelve sometimes carrying a brown paper bag that the neighborhood assumed contained the family groceries
235,i never knew how old mr radley made his living  jem said he bought cotton a polite term for doing nothing  but mr radley and his wife had lived there with their two sons as long as anybody could remember
171,the shutters and doors of the radley house were closed on sundays another thing alien to maycombs ways closed doors meant illness and cold weather only
129,of all days sunday was the day for formal afternoon visiting ladies wore corsets men wore coats children wore shoes
124,but to climb the radley front steps and call hey of a sunday afternoon was something their neighbors never did
36,the radley house had no screen doors
84,i once asked atticus if it ever had any atticus said yes but before i was born
328,according to neighborhood legend when the younger radley boy was in his teens he became acquainted with some of the cunninghams from old sarum an enormous and confusing tribe domiciled in the northern part of the county and they formed the nearest thing to a gang ever seen in maycomb
394,they did little but enough to be discussed by the town and publicly warned from three pulpits they hung around the barbershop they rode the bus to abbottsville on sundays and went to the picture show they attended dances at the countys riverside gambling hell the dewdrop inn amp fishing camp they experimented with stumphole whiskey
99,nobody in maycomb had nerve enough to tell mr radley that his boy was in with the wrong crowd
211,one night in an excessive spurt of high spirits the boys backed around the square in a borrowed flivver resisted arrest by maycomb s ancient beadle mr conner and locked him in the courthouse outhouse
400,the town decided something had to be done mr conner said he knew who each and every one of them was and he was bound and determined they wouldnt get away with it so the boys came before the probate judge on charges of disorderly conduct disturbing the peace assault and battery and using abusive and profane language in the presence and hearing of a female
173,the judge asked mr conner why he included the last charge mr conner said they cussed so loud he was sure every lady in maycomb heard them
220,the judge decided to send the boys to the state industrial school where boys were sometimes sent for no other reason than to provide them with food and decent shelter it was no prison and it was no disgrace
24,mr radley thought it was
99,if the judge released arthur mr radley would see to it that arthur gave no further trouble
73,knowing that mr radley s word was his bond the judge was glad to do so
200,the other boys attended the industrial school and received the best secondary education to be had in the state one of them eventually worked his way through engineering school at auburn
149,the doors of the radley house were closed on weekdays as well as sundays and mr radley s boy was not seen again for fifteen years
145,but there came a day barely within jems memory when boo radley was heard from and was seen by several people but not by jem
323,he said atticus never talked much about the radleys when jem would question him atticuss only answer was for him to mind his own business and let the radleys mind theirs they had a right to but when it happened jem said atticus shook his head and said mm mm mm
135, so jem received most of his information from miss stephanie crawford a neighborhood scold who said she knew the whole thing
143,according to miss stephanie boo was sitting in the livingroom cutting some items from the maycomb tribune to paste in his scrapbook
29,his father entered the room
148,as mr radley passed by boo drove the scissors into his parents leg pulled them out wiped them on his pants and resumed his activities
194,mrs radley ran screaming into the street that arthur was killing them all but when the sheriff arrived he found boo still sitting in the livingroom cutting up the tribune
37,he was thirtythree years old then
169,miss stephanie said old mr radley said no radley was going to any asylum when it was suggested that a season in tuscaloosa might be helpful to boo
49,boo wasnt crazy he was highstrung at times
138,it was all right to shut him up mr radley conceded but insisted that boo not be charged with anything he was not a criminal
119,the sheriff hadnt the heart to put him in jail alongside negroes so boo was locked in the courthouse basement
82,boos transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in jems memory
151,miss stephanie crawford said some of the town council told mr radley that if he didnt take boo back boo would die of mold from the damp
67,besides boo could not live forever on the bounty of the county
177,nobody knew what form of intimidation mr radley employed to keep boo out of sight but jem figured that mr radley kept him chained to the bed most of the time
109,atticus said no it wasnt that sort of thing that there were other ways of making people into ghosts
146,my memory came alive to see mrs radley occasionally open the front door walk to the edge of the porch and pour water on her cannas
74,but every day jem and i would see mr radley walking to and from town
93,he was a thin leathery man with colorless eyes so colorless they did not reflect light
98,his cheekbones were sharp and his mouth was wide with a thin upper lip and a full lower lip
178,miss stephanie crawford said he was so upright he took the word of god as his only law and we believed her because mr radleys posture was ramrod straight
21,he never spoke to us
104,when he passed we would look at the ground and say good morning sir and he would cough in reply
152,mr radleys elder son lived in pensacola he came home at christmas and he was one of the few persons we ever saw enter or leave the place
74,from the day mr radley took arthur home people said the house died
192,but there came a day when atticus told us hed wear us out if we made any noise in the yard and commissioned calpurnia to serve in his absence if she heard a sound out of us
18,mr radley was dying
25,he took his time about it
154,wooden sawhorses blocked the road at each end of the radley lot straw was put down on the sidewalk traffic was diverted to the back street
112,dr reynolds parked his car in front of our house and walked to the radleys every time he called
41,jem and i crept around the yard for days
143,at last the sawhorses were taken away and we stood watching from the front porch when mr radley made his final journey past our house
121,there goes the meanest man ever god blew breath into murmured calpurnia and she spat meditatively into the yard
96,we looked at her in surprise for calpurnia rarely commented on the ways of white people
194,the neighborhood thought when mr radley went under boo would come out but it had another think coming boos elder brother returned from pensacola and took mr radleys place
65,the only difference between him and his father was their ages
47,jem said mr nathan radley bought cotton too
147,mr nathan would speak to us however when we said good morning and sometimes we saw him coming from town with a magazine in his hand
167,the more we told dill about the radleys the more he wanted to know the longer he would stand hugging the lightpole on the corner the more he would wonder
47,wonder what he does in there he would murmur
49,looks like hed just stick his head out the door
58, jem said he goes out all right when its pitch dark
157,miss stephanie crawford said she woke up in the middle of the night one time and saw him looking straight through the window at her
47,said his head was like a skull lookin at her
61,aint you ever waked up at night and heard him dill
57,he walks like this jem slid his feet through the gravel
59,why do you think miss rachel locks up so tight at night
162,ive seen his tracks in our back yard many a mornin and one night i heard him scratching on the back screen but he was gone time atticus got there
28, wonder what he looks like
282,jem gave a reasonable description of boo boo was about sixandahalf feet tall judging from his tracks he dined on raw squirrels and any cats he could catch thats why his hands were bloodstained  if you ate an animal raw you could never wash the blood off
159,there was a long jagged scar that ran across his face what teeth he had were yellow and rotten his eyes popped and he drooled most of the time
40,lets try to make him come out said dill
33,id like to see what he looks like
104, jem said if dill wanted to get himself killed all he had to do was go up and knock on the front door
154,our first raid came to pass only because dill bet jem the gray ghost against two tom swifts that jem wouldnt get any farther than the radley gate
50,in all his life jem had never declined a dare
38,jem thought about it for three days
120,i suppose he loved honor more than his head for dill wore him down easily youre scared dill said the first day
36,aint scared just respectful jem said
95,the next day dill said youre too scared even to put your big toe in the front yard
95, jem said he reckoned he wasnt hed passed the radley place every school day of his life
21,always runnin i said
200,but dill got him the third day when he told jem that folks in meridian certainly werent as afraid as the folks in maycomb that hed never seen such scary folks as the ones in maycomb
169,this was enough to make jem march to the corner where he stopped and leaned against the lightpole watching the gate hanging crazily on its homemade hinge
134,i hope youve got it through your head that hell kill us each and every one dill harris said jem when we joined him
47,dont blame me when he gouges your eyes out
24,you started it remember
45, youre still scared murmured dill patiently
164,jem wanted dill to know once and for all that he wasnt scared of anything its just that i cant think of a way to make him come out without him gettin us
48, besides jem had his little sister to think of
43,when he said that i knew he was afraid
142,jem had his little sister to think of the time i dared him to jump off the top of the house if i got killed whatd become of you
117,then he jumped landed unhurt and his sense of responsibility left him until confronted by the radley place
31,you gonna run out on a dare
12, asked dill
71,if you are then dill you have to think about these things jem said
21,lemme think a minute
44,its sort of like making a turtle come out
10, asked dill
26,strike a match under him
84, i told jem if he set fire to the radley house i was going to tell atticus on him
58,dill said striking a match under a turtle was hateful
102,aint hateful just persuades him  s not like youd chunk him in the fire jem growled
41,how do you know a match dont hurt him
36, turtles cant feel stupid said jem
29,were you ever a turtle huh
12, my stars dill
17,now lemme think
21,reckon we can rock him
180, jem stood in thought so long that dill made a mild concession i wont say you ran out on a dare an ill swap you the gray ghost if you just go up and touch the house
14, jem brightened
27,touch the house that all
11, dill nodded
19,sure thats all now
75,i dont want you hollerin something different the minute i get back
24, yeah thats all said dill
169,hell probably come out after you when he sees you in the yard then scoutn mell jump on him and hold him down till we can tell him we aint gonna hurt him
119, we left the corner crossed the side street that ran in front of the radley house and stopped at the gate
55,well go on said dill scout and mes right behind you
38, im going said jem dont hurry me
188, he walked to the corner of the lot then back again studying the simple terrain as if deciding how best to effect an entry frowning and scratching his head
21,then i sneered at him
172,jem threw open the gate and sped to the side of the house slapped it with his palm and ran back past us not waiting to see if his foray was successful
35,dill and i followed on his heels
64,safely on our porch panting and out of breath we looked back
122,the old house was the same droopy and sick but as we stared down the street we thought we saw an inside shutter move
57,a tiny almost invisible movement and the house was still
86,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  dill left us early in september to return to meridian
150,we saw him off on the five oclock bus and i was miserable without him until it occurred to me that i would be starting to school in a week
50,i never looked forward more to anything in my life
344,hours of wintertime had found me in the treehouse looking over at the schoolyard spying on multitudes of children through a twopower telescope jem had given me learning their games following jems red jacket through wriggling circles of blind mans buff secretly sharing their misfortunes and minor victories
21,i longed to join them
173,jem condescended to take me to school the first day a job usually done by ones parents but atticus had said jem would be delighted to show me where my room was
182,i think some money changed hands in this transaction for as we trotted around the corner past the radley place i heard an unfamiliar jingle in jems pockets
333,when we slowed to a walk at the edge of the schoolyard jem was careful to explain that during school hours i was not to bother him i was not to approach him with requests to enact a chapter of tarzan and the ant men to embarrass him with references to his private life or tag along behind him at recess and noon
75,i was to stick with the first grade and he would stick with the fifth
34,in short i was to leave him alone
29,you mean we cant play any more
80,well do like we always do at home he said but youll see  schools different
18, it certainly was
213,before the first morning was over miss caroline fisher our teacher hauled me up to the front of the room and patted the palm of my hand with a ruler then made me stand in the corner until noon
46,miss caroline was no more than twentyone
78,she had bright auburn hair pink cheeks and wore crimson fingernail polish
66,she also wore highheeled pumps and a red and whitestriped dress
49,she looked and smelled like a peppermint drop
186,she boarded across the street one door down from us in miss maudie atkinsons upstairs front room and when miss maudie introduced us to her jem was in a haze for days
101,miss caroline printed her name on the blackboard and said this says i am miss caroline fisher
46,i am from north alabama from winston county
139, the class murmured apprehensively should she prove to harbor her share of the peculiarities indigenous to that region
144,when alabama seceded from the union on january   winston county seceded from alabama and every child in maycomb county knew it
146, north alabama was full of liquor interests big mules steel companies republicans professors and other persons of no background
69,miss caroline began the day by reading us a story about cats
150,the cats had long conversations with one another they wore cunning little clothes and lived in a warm house beneath a kitchen stove
153,by the time mrs cat called the drugstore for an order of chocolate malted mice the class was wriggling like a bucketful of catawba worms
227,miss caroline seemed unaware that the ragged denimshirted and floursackskirted first grade most of whom had chopped cotton and fed hogs from the time they were able to walk were immune to imaginative literature
80,miss caroline came to the end of the story and said oh my wasnt that nice
164, then she went to the blackboard and printed the alphabet in enormous square capitals turned to the class and asked does anybody know what these are
75, everybody did most of the first grade had failed it last year
358,i suppose she chose me because she knew my name as i read the alphabet a faint line appeared between her eyebrows and after making me read most of my first reader and the stockmarket quotations from the mobile register aloud she discovered that i was literate and looked at me with more than faint distaste
103,miss caroline told me to tell my father not to teach me any more it would interfere with my reading
20, i said in surprise
43,he hasnt taught me anything miss caroline
108,atticus aint got time to teach me anything i added when miss caroline smiled and shook her head
66,why hes so tired at night he just sits in the livingroom and reads
32, if he didnt teach you who did
36, miss caroline asked goodnaturedly
12,somebody did
52,you werent born reading the mobile register
15, jem says i was
66,he read in a book where i was a bullfinch instead of a finch
162,jem says my names really jean louise bullfinch that i got swapped when i was born and im really a miss caroline apparently thought i was lying
66,lets not let our imaginations run away with us dear she said
53,now you tell your father not to teach you any more
46,its best to begin reading with a fresh mind
72,you tell him ill take over from here and try to undo the damage maam
38, your father does not know how to teach
23,you can have a seat now
67, i mumbled that i was sorry and retired meditating upon my crime
118,i never deliberately learned to read but somehow i had been wallowing illicitly in the daily papers
59,in the long hours of church  was it then i learned
49,i could not remember not being able to read hymns
236,now that i was compelled to think about it reading was something that just came to me as learning to fasten the seat of my union suit without looking around or achieving two bows from a snarl of shoelaces
349,i could not remember when the lines above atticuss moving finger separated into words but i had stared at them all the evenings in my memory listening to the news of the day bills to be enacted into laws the diaries of lorenzo dow  anything atticus happened to be reading when i crawled into his lap every night
57,until i feared i would lose it i never loved to read
27,one does not love breathing
183,i knew i had annoyed miss caroline so i let well enough alone and stared out the window until recess when jem cut me from the covey of firstgraders in the schoolyard
37,he asked how i was getting along
33,if i didnt have to stay id leave
123,jem that damn lady says atticuss been teaching me to read and for him to stop it dont worry scout jem comforted me
68,our teacher says miss carolines introducing a new way of teaching
32,she learned about it in college
33,itll be in all the grades soon
119,you dont have to learn much out of books that way  its like if you wanta learn about cows you go milk one see
60, yeah jem but i dont wanta study cows i sure you do
76,you hafta know about cows theyre a big part of life in maycomb county
58, i contented myself with asking jem if hed lost his mind
83,im just trying to tell you the new way theyre teachin the first grade stubborn
27,its the dewey decimal system
81, having never questioned jems pronouncements i saw no reason to begin now
141,the dewey decimal system consisted in part of miss caroline waving cards at us on which were printed the cat rat man and you
114, no comment seemed to be expected of us and the class received these impressionistic revelations in silence
40,i was bored so i began a letter to dill
85,miss caroline caught me writing and told me to tell my father to stop teaching me
17,besides she said
44,we dont write in the first grade we print
57,you wont learn to write until youre in the third grade
34, calpurnia was to blame for this
56,it kept me from driving her crazy on rainy days i guess
146,she would set me a writing task by scrawling the alphabet firmly across the top of a tablet then copying out a chapter of the bible beneath
125,if i reproduced her penmanship satisfactorily she rewarded me with an openfaced sandwich of bread and butter and sugar
112,in calpurnia s teaching there was no sentimentality i seldom pleased her and she seldom rewarded me
127,everybody who goes home to lunch hold up your hands said miss caroline breaking into my new grudge against calpurnia
51,the town children did so and she looked us over
59,everybody who brings his lunch put it on top of his desk
91, molasses buckets appeared from nowhere and the ceiling danced with metallic light
163,miss caroline walked up and down the rows peering and poking into lunch containers nodding if the contents pleased her frowning a little at others
42,she stopped at walter cunninghams desk
13,wheres yours
81,walter cunninghams face told everybody in the first grade he had hookworms
46,his absence of shoes told us how he got them
78,people caught hookworms going barefooted in barnyards and hog wallows
125,if walter had owned any shoes he would have worn them the first day of school and then discarded them until mid winter
61,he did have on a clean shirt and neatly mended overalls
40,did you forget your lunch this morning
20, asked miss caroline
30,walter looked straight ahead
39,i saw a muscle jump in his skinny jaw
31,did you forget it this morning
21, asked miss caroline
29,walters jaw twitched again
24,yebm he finally mumbled
52,miss caroline went to her desk and opened her purse
37,heres a quarter she said to walter
25,go and eat downtown today
29,you can pay me back tomorrow
21, walter shook his head
39,nome thank you maam he drawled softly
70,impatience crept into miss carolines voice here walter come get it
31, walter shook his head again
86,when walter shook his head a third time someone whispered go on and tell her scout
99, i turned around and saw most of the town people and the entire bus delegation looking at me
158,miss caroline and i had conferred twice already and they were looking at me in the innocent assurance that familiarity breeds understanding
58,i rose graciously on walters behalf ah  miss caroline
24, what is it jean louise
31, miss caroline hes a cunningham
17, i sat back down
17,what jean louise
53, i thought i had made things sufficiently clear
101,it was clear enough to the rest of us walter cunningham was sitting there lying his head off
46,he didnt forget his lunch he didnt have any
66,he had none today nor would he have any tomorrow or the next day
84,he had probably never seen three quarters together at the same time in his life
62,i tried again walters one of the cunninghams miss caroline
34, i beg your pardon jean louise
75, thats okay maam youll get to know all the county folks after a while
98,the cunninghams never took anything they cant pay back  no church baskets and no scrip stamps
76,they never took anything off of anybody they get along on what they have
44,they dont have much but they get along on it
123, my special knowledge of the cunningham tribe  one branch that is  was gained from events of last winter
45,walters father was one of atticuss clients
180,after a dreary conversation in our livingroom one night about his entailment before mr cunningham left he said mr finch i dont know when ill ever be able to pay you
66, let that be the least of your worries walter atticus said
179,when i asked jem what entailment was and jem described it as a condition of having your tail in a crack i asked atticus if mr cunningham would ever pay us
79,not in money atticus said but before the years out ill have been paid
11, we watched
71,one morning jem and i found a load of stovewood in the back yard
57,later a sack of hickory nuts appeared on the back steps
49,with christmas came a crate of smilax and holly
109,that spring when we found a crokersack full of turnip greens atticus said mr cunningham had more than paid him
34,why does he pay you like that
42,because thats the only way he can pay me
15,he has no money
22, are we poor atticus
15, atticus nodded
12,we are indeed
19, jems nose wrinkled
32,are we as poor as the cunninghams
12, not exactly
80,the cunninghams are country folks farmers and the crash hit them hardest
79, atticus said professional people were poor because the farmers were poor
116,as maycomb county was farm country nickels and dimes were hard to come by for doctors and dentists and lawyers
65,entailment was only a part of mr cunninghams vexations
111,the acres not entailed were mortgaged to the hilt and the little cash he made went to interest
194,if he held his mouth right mr cunningham could get a wpa job but his land would go to ruin if he left it and he was willing to go hungry to keep his land and vote as he pleased
59,mr cunningham said atticus came from a set breed of men
99,as the cunninghams had no money to pay a lawyer they simply paid us with what they had
69,did you know said atticus that dr reynolds works the same way
69,he charges some folks a bushel of potatoes for delivery of a baby
79,miss scout if you give me your attention ill tell you what entailment is
54,jems definitions are very nearly accurate sometimes
276, if i could have explained these things to miss caroline i would have saved myself some inconvenience and miss caroline subsequent mortification but it was beyond my ability to explain things as well as atticus so i said youre shamin him miss caroline
86,walter hasnt got a quarter at home to bring you and you cant use any stovewood
109, miss caroline stood stock still then grabbed me by the collar and hauled me back to her desk
66,jean louise ive had about enough of you this morning she said
61,youre starting off on the wrong foot in every way my dear
18,hold out your hand
184, i thought she was going to spit in it which was the only reason anybody in maycomb held out his hand it was a timehonored method of sealing oral contracts
134,wondering what bargain we had made i turned to the class for an answer but the class looked back at me in puzzlement
121,miss caroline picked up her ruler gave me half a dozen quick little pats then told me to stand in the corner
117,a storm of laughter broke loose when it finally occurred to the class that miss caroline had whipped me
163,when miss caroline threatened it with a similar fate the first grade exploded again becoming cold sober only when the shadow of miss blount fell over them
226,miss blount a native maycombian as yet uninitiated in the mysteries of the decimal system appeared at the door hands on hips and announced if i hear another sound from this room ill burn up everybody in it
92,miss caroline the sixth grade cannot concentrate on the pyramids for all this racket
39, my sojourn in the corner was a short one
77,saved by the bell miss caroline watched the class file out for lunch
101,as i was the last to leave i saw her sink down into her chair and bury her head in her arms
86,had her conduct been more friendly toward me i would have felt sorry for her
34,she was a pretty little thing
191,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  catching walter cunningham in the schoolyard gave me some pleasure but when i was rubbing his nose in the dirt jem came by and told me to stop
29,youre biggern he is he said
32,hes as old as you nearly i said
42,he made me start off on the wrong foot
18, let him go scout
96, he didnt have any lunch i said and explained my involvement in walters dietary affairs
84,walter had picked himself up and was standing quietly listening to jem and me
78,his fists were half cocked as if expecting an onslaught from both of us
81,i stomped at him to chase him away but jem put out his hand and stopped me
48,he examined walter with an air of speculation
50,your daddy mr walter cunningham from old sarum
29, he asked and walter nodded
114,walter looked as if he had been raised on fish food his eyes as blue as dill harriss were redrimmed and watery
88,there was no color in his face except at the tip of his nose which was moistly pink
82,he fingered the straps of his overalls nervously picking at the metal hooks
27,jem suddenly grinned at him
47,come on home to dinner with us walter he said
24,wed be glad to have you
39, walters face brightened then darkened
47,jem said our daddys a friend of your daddys
56,scout here shes crazy  she wont fight you any more
44, i wouldnt be too certain of that i said
100,jems free dispensation of my pledge irked me but precious noontime minutes were ticking away
36,yeah walter i wont jump on you again
28,dont you like butterbeans
26,our cals a real good cook
45, walter stood where he was biting his lip
102,jem and i gave up and we were nearly to the radley place when walter called hey im comin 
80, when walter caught up with us jem made pleasant conversation with him
76,a haint lives there he said cordially pointing to the radley house
29,ever hear about him walter
29, reckon i have said walter
157,almost died first year i come to school and et them pecans  folks say he pizened em and put em over on the school side of the fence
89, jem seemed to have little fear of boo radley now that walter and i walked beside him
94,indeed jem grew boastful i went all the way up to the house once he said to walter
126,anybody who went up to the house once oughta not to still run every time he passes it i said to the clouds above
28,and whos runnin miss priss
41, you are when aint anybody with you
87, by the time we reached our front steps walter had forgotten he was a cunningham
92,jem ran to the kitchen and asked calpurnia to set an extra plate we had company
92,atticus greeted walter and began a discussion about crops neither jem nor i could follow
184,reason i cant pass the first grade mr finch is ive had to stay out ever spring an help papa with the choppin but theres anothern at the house now thats field size
46, did you pay a bushel of potatoes for him
42, i asked but atticus shook his head at me
129,while walter piled food on his plate he and atticus talked together like two men to the wonderment of jem and me
119,atticus was expounding upon farm problems when walter interrupted to ask if there was any molasses in the house
68,atticus summoned calpurnia who returned bearing the syrup pitcher
57,she stood waiting for walter to help himself
72,walter poured syrup on his vegetables and meat with a generous hand
105,he would probably have poured it into his milk glass had i not asked what the sam hill he was doing
108,the silver saucer clattered when he replaced the pitcher and he quickly put his hands in his lap
24,then he ducked his head
35,atticus shook his head at me again
63,but hes gone and drowned his dinner in syrup i protested
94,hes poured it all over it was then that calpurnia requested my presence in the kitchen
87,she was furious and when she was furious calpurnia s grammar became erratic
77,when in tranquility her grammar was as good as anybodys in maycomb
69,atticus said calpurnia had more education than most colored folks
74,when she squinted down at me the tiny lines around her eyes deepened
149,theres some folks who dont eat like us she whispered fiercely but you aint called on to contradict em at the table when they dont
87,that boys yo compny and if he wants to eat up the table cloth you let him you hear
64, he aint company cal hes just a cunningham hush your mouth
167,dont matter who they are anybody sets foot in this houses yo compny and dont you let me catch you remarkin on their ways like you was so high and mighty
204,yo folks might be bettern the cunninghams but it dont count for nothin the way youre disgracin em  if you cant act fit to eat at the table you can just set here and eat in the kitchen
90, calpurnia sent me through the swinging door to the diningroom with a stinging smack
159,i retrieved my plate and finished dinner in the kitchen thankful though that i was spared the humiliation of facing them again
160,i told calpurnia to just wait id fix her one of these days when she wasnt looking id go off and drown myself in barkers eddy and then shed be sorry
127,besides i added shed already gotten me in trouble once today she had taught me to write and it was all her fault
27,hush your fussin she said
170,jem and walter returned to school ahead of me staying behind to advise atticus of calpurnias iniquities was worth a solitary sprint past the radley place
127,she likes jem bettern she likes me anyway i concluded and suggested that atticus lose no time in packing her off
70,have you ever considered that jem doesnt worry her half as much
26, atticuss voice was flinty
53,ive no intention of getting rid of her now or ever
77,we couldnt operate a single day without cal have you ever thought of that
72,you think about how much cal does for you and you mind her you hear
107, i returned to school and hated calpurnia steadily until a sudden shriek shattered my resentments
104,i looked up to see miss caroline standing in the middle of the room sheer horror flooding her face
73,apparently she had revived enough to persevere in her profession
13, she screamed
74,the male population of the class rushed as one to her assistance
44,lord i thought shes scared of a mouse
120,little chuck little whose patience with all living things was phenomenal said which way did he go miss caroline
27,tell us where he went quick
73,dc he turned to a boy behind him  dc shut the door and well catch him
23,quick maam whered he go
125, miss caroline pointed a shaking finger not at the floor nor at a desk but to a hulking individual unknown to me
69,little chucks face contracted and he said gently you mean him maam
15,yessum hes alive
24,did he scare you some way
102, miss caroline said desperately i was just walking by when it crawled out of his hair
61,just crawled out of his hair little chuck grinned broadly
41,there aint no need to fear a cootie maam
22,aint you ever seen one
82,now dont you be afraid you just go back to your desk and teach us some more
156, little chuck little was another member of the population who didnt know where his next meal was coming from but he was a born gentleman
82,he put his hand under her elbow and led miss caroline to the front of the room
33,now dont you fret maam he said
40,there aint no need to fear a cootie
36,ill just fetch you some cool water
83, the cooties host showed not the faintest interest in the furor he had wrought
121,he searched the scalp above his forehead located his guest and pinched it between his thumb and forefinger
60,miss caroline watched the process in horrid fascination
78,little chuck brought water in a paper cup and she drank it gratefully
25,finally she found her voice
22,what is your name son
18, she asked softly
14,the boy blinked
21, miss caroline nodded
13,burris ewell
36, miss caroline inspected her rollbook
51,i have a ewell here but i dont have a first name
41,would you spell your first name for me
15, dont know how
25,they call me burrist home
95, well burris said miss caroline i think wed better excuse you for the rest of the afternoon
43,i want you to go home and wash your hair
101, from her desk she produced a thick volume leafed through its pages and read for a moment
94,a good home remedy for  burris i want you to go home and wash your hair with lye soap
55,when youve done that treat your scalp with kerosene
18, what fer missus
29, to get rid of the  er cooties
93,you see burris the other children might catch them and you wouldnt want that would you
17, the boy stood up
43,he was the filthiest human i had ever seen
120,his neck was dark gray the backs of his hands were rusty and his fingernails were black deep into the quick
70,he peered at miss caroline from a fistsized clean space on his face
118,no one had noticed him probably because miss caroline and i had entertained the class most of the morning
96,and burris said miss caroline please bathe yourself before you come back tomorrow
23, the boy laughed rudely
31,you aint sendin me home missus
67,i was on the verge of leavin  i done done my time for this year
31, miss caroline looked puzzled
26,what do you mean by that
24, the boy did not answer
37,he gave a short contemptuous snort
169,one of the elderly members of the class answered her hes one of the ewells maam and i wondered if this explanation would be as unsuccessful as my attempt
46,but miss caroline seemed willing to listen
23,whole schools full of em
47,they come first day every year and then leave
107,the truant lady gets em here cause she threatens em with the sheriff but shes give up tryin to hold em
121,she reckons shes carried out the law just gettin their names on the roll and runnin em here the first day
54,youre supposed to mark em absent the rest of the year
34, but what about their parents
41, asked miss caroline in genuine concern
71,aint got no mother was the answer and their paws right contentious
52, burris ewell was flattered by the recital
94,been comin to the first day o the first grade fer three year now he said expansively
64,reckon if im smart this year theyll promote me to the second
131, miss caroline said sit back down please burris and the moment she said it i knew she had made a serious mistake
40,the boys condescension flashed to anger
27,you try and make me missus
38, little chuck little got to his feet
23,let him go maam he said
37,hes a mean one a harddown mean one
64,hes liable to start somethin and theres some little folks here
145, he was among the most diminutive of men but when burris ewell turned toward him little chucks right hand went to his pocket
34,watch your step burris he said
35,id soons kill you as look at you
12,now go home
146, burris seemed to be afraid of a child half his height and miss caroline took advantage of his indecision burris go home
46,if you dont ill call the principal she said
33,ill have to report this anyway
52, the boy snorted and slouched leisurely to the door
71,safely out of range he turned and shouted report and be damned to ye
83,aint no snotnosed slut of a schoolteacher ever born cn make me do nothin
38,you aint makin me go nowhere missus
58,you just remember that you aint makin me go nowhere
87, he waited until he was sure she was crying then he shuffled out of the building
91,soon we were clustered around her desk trying in our various ways to comfort her
25,he was a real mean one
15,below the belt
45,you aint called on to teach folks like that
48,them aint maycombs ways miss caroline not really
23,now dont you fret maam
42,miss caroline why dont you read us a story
46,that cat thing was real fine this mornin 
194,miss caroline smiled blew her nose said thank you darlings dispersed us opened a book and mystified the first grade with a long narrative about a toadfrog that lived in a hall
137,when i passed the radley place for the fourth time that day  twice at a full gallop  my gloom had deepened to match the house
246,if the remainder of the school year were as fraught with drama as the first day perhaps it would be mildly entertaining but the prospect of spending nine months refraining from reading and writing made me think of running away
196,by late afternoon most of my traveling plans were complete when jem and i raced each other up the sidewalk to meet atticus coming home from work i didnt give him much of a race
120,it was our habit to run meet atticus the moment we saw him round the post office corner in the distance
113,atticus seemed to have forgotten my noontime fall from grace he was full of questions about school
57,my replies were monosyllabic and he did not press me
93,perhaps calpurnia sensed that my day had been a grim one she let me watch her fix supper
79,shut your eyes and open your mouth and ill give you a surprise she said
161,it was not often that she made crackling bread she said she never had time but with both of us at school today had been an easy one for her
37,she knew i loved crackling bread
30,i missed you today she said
83,the house got so lonesome long about two oclock i had to turn on the radio
54,jemn me aint ever in the house unless its rainin
65, i know she said but one of yous always in callin distance
63,i wonder how much of the day i spend just callin after you
111,well she said getting up from the kitchen chair its enough time to make a pan of cracklin bread i reckon
59,you run along now and let me get supper on the table
35, calpurnia bent down and kissed me
49,i ran along wondering what had come over her
50,she had wanted to make up with me that was it
139,she had always been too hard on me she had at last seen the error of her fractious ways she was sorry and too stubborn to say so
34,i was weary from the days crimes
87,after supper atticus sat down with the paper and called scout ready to read
78, the lord sent me more than i could bear and i went to the front porch
19,atticus followed me
23,something wrong scout
125, i told atticus i didnt feel very well and didnt think id go to school any more if it was all right with him
56,atticus sat down in the swing and crossed his legs
102,his fingers wandered to his watchpocket he said that was the only way he could think
149,he waited in amiable silence and i sought to reinforce my position you never went to school and you do all right so ill just stay home too
60,you can teach me like granddaddy taught you n uncle jack
26, no i cant said atticus
21,i have to make a living
111,besides theyd put me in jail if i kept you at home  dose of magnesia for you tonight and school tomorrow
29, im feeling all right really
11, thought so
23,now whats the matter
124, bit by bit i told him the days misfortunes and she said you taught me all wrong so we cant ever read any more ever
35,please dont send me back please sir
58, atticus stood up and walked to the end of the porch
84,when he completed his examination of the wisteria vine he strolled back to me
126,first of all he said if you can learn a simple trick scout youll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks
94,you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view sir
57, until you climb into his skin and walk around in it
112, atticus said i had learned many things today and miss caroline had learned several things herself
202,she had learned not to hand something to a cunningham for one thing but if walter and i had put ourselves in her shoes wed have seen it was an honest mistake on her part
135,we could not expect her to learn all maycombs ways in one day and we could not hold her responsible when she knew no better
19,ill be dogged i said
127,i didnt know no better than not to read to her and she held me responsible  listen atticus i dont have to go to school
36, i was bursting with a sudden thought
21,burris ewell remember
35,he just goes to school the first day
138,the truant lady reckons shes carried out the law when she gets his name on the roll you cant do that scout atticus said
67,sometimes its better to bend the law a little in special cases
44,in your case the law remains rigid
23,so to school you must go
42, i dont see why i have to when he doesnt
10, then listen
90, atticus said the ewells had been the disgrace of maycomb for three generations
66,none of them had done an honest days work in his recollection
148,he said that some christmas when he was getting rid of the tree he would take me with him and show me where and how they lived
47,they were people but they lived like animals
124,they can go to school any time they want to when they show the faintest symptom of wanting an education said atticus
187,there are ways of keeping them in school by force but its silly to force people like the ewells into a new environment if i didnt go to school tomorrow youd force me to
46, let us leave it at this said atticus dryly
45,you miss scout finch are of the common folk
22,you must obey the law
82, he said that the ewells were members of an exclusive society made up of ewells
175,in certain circumstances the common folk judiciously allowed them certain privileges by the simple method of becoming blind to some of the ewells activities
51,they didnt have to go to school for one thing
94,another thing mr bob ewell burriss father was permitted to hunt and trap out of season
23,atticus thats bad i said
121,in maycomb county hunting out of season was a misdemeanor at law a capital felony in the eyes of the populace
208,its against the law all right said my father and its certainly bad but when a man spends his relief checks on green whiskey his children have a way of crying from hunger pains
106,i dont know of any landowner around here who begrudges those children any game their father can hit
89, mr ewell shouldnt do that of course he shouldnt but hell never change his ways
60,are you going to take out your disapproval on his children
119, no sir i murmured and made a final stand but if i keep on goin to school we cant ever read any more
38, thats really bothering you isnt it
112, when atticus looked down at me i saw the expression on his face that always made me expect something
34,do you know what a compromise is
16,bending the law
49, no an agreement reached by mutual concessions
27,it works this way he said
112,if youll concede the necessity of going to school well go on reading every night just as we always have
16,is it a bargain
109, well consider it sealed without the usual formality atticus said when he saw me preparing to spit
129,as i opened the front screen door atticus said by the way scout youd better not say anything at school about our agreement
113, im afraid our activities would be received with considerable disapprobation by the more learned authorities
194, jem and i were accustomed to our fathers lastwillandtestament diction and we were at all times free to interrupt atticus for a translation when it was beyond our understanding
192, i never went to school he said but i have a feeling that if you tell miss caroline we read every night shell get after me and i wouldnt want her after me
251, atticus kept us in fits that evening gravely reading columns of print about a man who sat on a flagpole for no discernible reason which was reason enough for jem to spend the following saturday aloft in the treehouse
136,jem sat from after breakfast until sunset and would have remained overnight had not atticus severed his supply lines
272,i had spent most of the day climbing up and down running errands for him providing him with literature nourishment and water and was carrying him blankets for the night when atticus said if i paid no attention to him jem would come down
18,atticus was right
115,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  the remainder of my schooldays were no more auspicious than the first
259,indeed they were an endless project that slowly evolved into a unit in which miles of construction paper and wax crayon were expended by the state of alabama in its wellmeaning but fruitless efforts to teach me group dynamics
165,what jem called the dewey decimal system was schoolwide by the end of my first year so i had no chance to compare it with other teaching techniques
145,i could only look around me atticus and my uncle who went to school at home knew everything  at least what one didnt know the other did
248,furthermore i couldnt help noticing that my father had served for years in the state legislature elected each time without opposition innocent of the adjustments my teachers thought essential to the development of good citizenship
233,jem educated on a halfdecimal half duncecap basis seemed to function effectively alone or in a group but jem was a poor example no tutorial system devised by man could have stopped him from getting at books
324,as for me i knew nothing except what i gathered from time magazine and reading everything i could lay hands on at home but as i inched sluggishly along the treadmill of the maycomb county school system i could not help receiving the impression that i was being cheated out of something
146,out of what i knew not yet i did not believe that twelve years of unrelieved boredom was exactly what the state had in mind for me
222,as the year passed released from school thirty minutes before jem who had to stay until three oclock i ran by the radley place as fast as i could not stopping until i reached the safety of our front porch
156,one afternoon as i raced by something caught my eye and caught it in such a way that i took a deep breath a long look around and went back
119,two live oaks stood at the edge of the radley lot their roots reached out into the sideroad and made it bumpy
64,something about one of the trees attracted my attention
108,some tinfoil was sticking in a knothole just above my eye level winking at me in the afternoon sun
149,i stood on tiptoe hastily looked around once more reached into the hole and withdrew two pieces of chewing gum minus their outer wrappers
109,my first impulse was to get it into my mouth as quickly as possible but i remembered where i was
60,i ran home and on our front porch i examined my loot
20,the gum looked fresh
43,i sniffed it and it smelled all right
33,i licked it and waited for a while
72,when i did not die i crammed it into my mouth wrigleys double mint
57,when jem came home he asked me where i got such a wad
23,i told him i found it
30,dont eat things you find scout
47, this wasnt on the ground it was in a tree
12, jem growled
18,well it was i said
66,it was sticking in that tree yonder the one comin from school
22, spit it out right now
15, i spat it out
27,the tang was fading anyway
73,ive been chewin it all afternoon and i aint dead yet not even sick
20, jem stamped his foot
77,dont you know youre not supposed to even touch the trees over there
28,youll get killed if you do
32, you touched the house once
21, that was different
37,you go gargle  right now you hear me
49, aint neither itll take the taste outa my mouth
38, you dont n ill tell calpurnia on you
65, rather than risk a tangle with calpurnia i did as jem told me
222,for some reason my first year of school had wrought a great change in our relationship calpurnias tyranny unfairness and meddling in my business had faded to gentle grumblings of general disapproval
68,on my part i went to much trouble sometimes not to provoke her
55,summer was on the way jem and i awaited it with impatience
264,summer was our best season it was sleeping on the back screened porch in cots or trying to sleep in the treehouse summer was everything good to eat it was a thousand colors in a parched landscape but most of all summer was dill
102,the authorities released us early the last day of school and jem and i walked home together
52,reckon old dillll be coming home tomorrow i said
27,probably day after said jem
38,missippi turns em loose a day later
282, as we came to the live oaks at the radley place i raised my finger to point for the hundredth time to the knothole where i had found the chewing gum trying to make jem believe i had found it there and found myself pointing at another piece of tinfoil
14,i see it scout
86,i see it jem looked around reached up and gingerly pocketed a tiny shiny package
139,we ran home and on the front porch we looked at a small box patchworked with bits of tinfoil collected from chewinggum wrappers
86,it was the kind of box wedding rings came in purple velvet with a minute catch
34,jem flicked open the tiny catch
74,inside were two scrubbed and polished pennies one on top of the other
18,jem examined them
18,indianheads he said
51,nineteensix and scout one of ems nineteenhundred
20,these are real old
26, nineteenhundred i echoed
31,say hush a minute im thinkin
45, jem you reckon thats somebodys hidin place
117, naw dont anybody much but us pass by there unless its some grown persons grown folks dont have hidin places
36,you reckon we ought to keep em jem
41, i dont know what we could do scout
25,whod we give em back to
130,i know for a fact dont anybody go by there  cecil goes by the back street an all the way around by town to get home
208, cecil jacobs who lived at the far end of our street next door to the post office walked a total of one mile per school day to avoid the radley place and old mrs henry lafayette dubose
152,mrs dubose lived two doors up the street from us neighborhood opinion was unanimous that mrs dubose was the meanest old woman who ever lived
60,jem wouldnt go by her place without atticus beside him
31,what you reckon we oughta do jem
49, finders were keepers unless title was proven
232,plucking an occasional camellia getting a squirt of hot milk from miss maudie atkinsons cow on a summer day helping ourselves to someones scuppernongs was part of our ethical culture but money was different
25,tell you what said jem
92,well keep em till school starts then go around and ask everybody if theyre theirs
101,theyre some bus childs maybe  he was too taken up with gettin outa school today an forgot em
31,these are somebodys i know that
31,see how theyve been slicked up
17,theyve been saved
74, yeah but why should somebody wanta put away chewing gum like that
22,you know it doesnt last
19, i dont know scout
35,but these are important to somebody
14, hows that jem
59, well indianheads  well they come from the indians
56,theyre real strong magic they make you have good luck
129,not like fried chicken when youre not lookin for it but things like long life n good health n passin sixweeks tests
36,these are real valuable to somebody
29,im gonna put em in my trunk
81, before jem went to his room he looked for a long time at the radley place
30,he seemed to be thinking again
444,two days later dill arrived in a blaze of glory he had ridden the train by himself from meridian to maycomb junction a courtesy title  maycomb junction was in abbott county where he had been met by miss rachel in maycomb s one taxi he had eaten dinner in the diner he had seen two twins hitched together get off the train in bay st louis and stuck to his story regardless of threats
231,he had discarded the abominable blue shorts that were buttoned to his shirts and wore real short pants with a belt he was somewhat heavier no taller and said he had seen his father
123,dills father was taller than ours he had a black beard pointed and was president of the l amp n railroad
55,i helped the engineer for a while said dill yawning
28,in a pigs ear you did dill
14,hush said jem
20,whatll we play today
33, tom and sam and dick said dill
27,lets go in the front yard
75, dill wanted the rover boys because there were three respectable parts
49,he was clearly tired of being our character man
26,im tired of those i said
184,i was tired of playing tom rover who suddenly lost his memory in the middle of a picture show and was out of the script until the end when he was found in alaska
25,make us up one jem i said
25,im tired of makin em up
46, our first days of freedom and we were tired
37,i wondered what the summer would bring
142,we had strolled to the front yard where dill stood looking down the street at the dreary face of the radley place
27,i  smell  death he said
51,i do i mean it he said when i told him to shut up
51,you mean when somebodys dyin you can smell it
64, no i mean i can smell somebody an tell if theyre gonna die
25,an old lady taught me how
33, dill leaned over and sniffed me
58,jean  louise  finch you are going to die in three days
49, dill if you dont hush ill knock you bowlegged
79,i mean it now yawl hush growled jem you act like you believe in hot steams
30, you act like you dont i said
19,whats a hot steam
11, asked dill
84,havent you ever walked along a lonesome road at night and passed by a hot place
15, jem asked dill
244,a hot steams somebody who cant get to heaven just wallows around on lonesome roads an if you walk through him when you die youll be one too an youll go around at night suckin peoples breath how can you keep from passing through one
18, you cant said jem
166,sometimes they stretch all the way across the road but if you hafta go through one you say angelbright lifeindeath get off the road dont suck my breath
87, that keeps em from wrapping around you dont you believe a word he says dill i said
30,calpurnia says thats nigger talk
88, jem scowled darkly at me but said well are we gonna play anything or not
36, lets roll in the tire i suggested
20,you know im too big
12, you cn push
78, i ran to the back yard and pulled an old car tire from under the house
34,i slapped it up to the front yard
15,im first i said
53,dill said he ought to be first he just got here
118,jem arbitrated awarded me first push with an extra time for dill and i folded myself inside the tire
176,until it happened i did not realize that jem was offended by my contradicting him on hot steams and that he was patiently awaiting an opportunity to reward me
78,he did by pushing the tire down the sidewalk with all the force in his body
92,ground sky and houses melted into a mad palette my ears throbbed i was suffocating
89,i could not put out my hands to stop they were wedged between my chest and knees
118,i could only hope that jem would outrun the tire and me or that i would be stopped by a bump in the sidewalk
47,i heard him behind me chasing and shouting
130,the tire bumped on gravel skeetered across the road crashed into a barrier and popped me like a cork onto pavement
161,dizzy and nauseated i lay on the cement and shook my head still pounded my ears to silence and heard jems voice scout get away from there come on
77, i raised my head and stared at the radley place steps in front of me
35,come on scout dont just lie there
19, jem was screaming
14,get up cantcha
44, i got to my feet trembling as i thawed
12,get the tire
13, jem hollered
17,bring it with you
30,aint you got any sense at all
99, when i was able to navigate i ran back to them as fast as my shaking knees would carry me
24,why didnt you bring it
11, jem yelled
20,why dont you get it
11, i screamed
13,jem was silent
32,go on it aint far inside the gate
47,why you even touched the house once remember
145, jem looked at me furiously could not decline ran down the sidewalk treaded water at the gate then dashed in and retrieved the tire
31, jem was scowling triumphantly
11,nothin to it
76,i swear scout sometimes you act so much like a girl its mortifyin
73, there was more to it than he knew but i decided not to tell him
66,calpurnia appeared in the front door and yelled lemonade time
52,you all get in outa that hot sun fore you fry alive
66, lemonade in the middle of the morning was a summertime ritual
88,calpurnia set a pitcher and three glasses on the porch then went about her business
63,being out of jems good graces did not worry me especially
39,lemonade would restore his good humor
61,jem gulped down his second glassful and slapped his chest
50,i know what we are going to play he announced
36,something new something different
11, asked dill
201, jems head at times was transparent he had thought that up to make me understand he wasnt afraid of radleys in any shape or form to contrast his own fearless heroism with my cowardice
11, asked dill
56,jem said scout you can be mrs radley i declare if i will
19,i dont think  smarter
12,still scared
49, he can get out at night when were all asleep
39,scout hows he gonna know what were doin
38,besides i dont think hes still there
58,he died years ago and they stuffed him up the chimney
72, dill said jem you and me can play and scout can watch if shes scared
226, i was fairly sure boo radley was inside that house but i couldnt prove it and felt it best to keep my mouth shut or i would be accused of believing in hot steams phenomena i was immune to in the daytime
105,jem parceled out our roles i was mrs radley and all i had to do was come out and sweep the porch
102,dill was old mr radley he walked up and down the sidewalk and coughed when jem spoke to him
100,jem naturally was boo he went under the front steps and shrieked and howled from time to time
43,as the summer progressed so did our game
140,we polished and perfected it added dialogue and plot until we had manufactured a small play upon which we rang changes every day
150,dill was a villains villain he could get into any character part assigned him and appear tall if height was part of the devilry required
78,he was as good as his worst performance his worst performance was gothic
59,i reluctantly played assorted ladies who entered the script
258,i never thought it as much fun as tarzan and i played that summer with more than vague anxiety despite jems assurances that boo radley was dead and nothing would get me with him and calpurnia there in the daytime and atticus home at night
20,jem was a born hero
197,it was a melancholy little drama woven from bits and scraps of gossip and neighborhood legend mrs radley had been beautiful until she married mr radley and lost all her money
88,she also lost most of her teeth her hair and her right forefinger dills contribution
82,boo bit it off one night when he couldnt find any cats and squirrels to eat
130, she sat in the livingroom and cried most of the time while boo slowly whittled away all the furniture in the house
204,the three of us were the boys who got into trouble i was the probate judge for a change dill led jem away and crammed him beneath the steps poking him with the brushbroom
184,jem would reappear as needed in the shapes of the sheriff assorted townsfolk and miss stephanie crawford who had more to say about the radleys than anybody in maycomb
224,when it was time to play boos big scene jem would sneak into the house steal the scissors from the sewingmachine drawer when calpurnia s back was turned then sit in the swing and cut up newspapers
89,dill would walk by cough at jem and jem would fake a plunge into dills thigh
36,from where i stood it looked real
213,when mr nathan radley passed us on his daily trip to town we would stand still and silent until he was out of sight then wonder what he would do to us if he suspected
188,our activities halted when any of the neighbors appeared and once i saw miss maudie atkinson staring across the street at us her hedge clippers poised in midair
205,one day we were so busily playing chapter xxv book ii of one mans family we did not see atticus standing on the sidewalk looking at us slapping a rolled magazine against his knee
25,the sun said twelve noon
23,what are you all playing
17,nothing said jem
61,jems evasion told me our game was a secret so i kept quiet
45,what are you doing with those scissors then
40,why are you tearing up that newspaper
27,if its todays ill tan you
13, nothing what
13, said atticus
11,nothing sir
39, give me those scissors atticus said
29,theyre no things to play with
64,does this by any chance have anything to do with the radleys
26, no sir said jem reddening
60,i hope it doesnt he said shortly and went inside the house
11,jem shut up
52,hes gone in the livingroom he can hear us in there
63, safely in the yard dill asked jem if we could play any more
11,i dont know
76,atticus didnt say we couldnt jem i said i think atticus knows it anyway
10, no he dont
26,if he did hed say he did
229, i was not so sure but jem told me i was being a girl that girls always imagined things thats why other people hated them so and if i started behaving like one i could just go off and find some to play with
44,all right you just keep it up then i said
14,youll find out
72, atticus s arrival was the second reason i wanted to quit the game
75,the first reason happened the day i rolled into the radley front yard
155,through all the head shaking quelling of nausea and jemyelling i had heard another sound so low i could not have heard it from the sidewalk
37,someone inside the house was laughing
191,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  my nagging got the better of jem eventually as i knew it would and to my relief we slowed down the game for a while
289,he still maintained however that atticus hadnt said we couldnt therefore we could and if atticus ever said we couldnt jem had thought of a way around it he would simply change the names of the characters and then we couldnt be accused of playing anything
57,dill was in hearty agreement with this plan of action
69,dill was becoming something of a trial anyway following jem about
94,he had asked me earlier in the summer to marry him then he promptly forgot about it
112,he staked me out marked as his property said i was the only girl he would ever love then he neglected me
75,i beat him up twice but it did no good he only grew closer to jem
120,they spent days together in the treehouse plotting and planning calling me only when they needed a third party
230,but i kept aloof from their more foolhardy schemes for a while and on pain of being called a girl i spent most of the remaining twilights that summer sitting with miss maudie atkinson on her front porch
162,jem and i had always enjoyed the free run of miss maudies yard if we kept out of her azaleas but our contact with her was not clearly defined
140,until jem and dill excluded me from their plans she was only another lady in the neighborhood but a relatively benign presence
359,our tacit treaty with miss maudie was that we could play on her lawn eat her scuppernongs if we didnt jump on the arbor and explore her vast back lot terms so generous we seldom spoke to her so careful were we to preserve the delicate balance of our relationship but jem and dill drove me closer to her with their behavior
64,miss maudie hated her house time spent indoors was time wasted
232,she was a widow a chameleon lady who worked in her flower beds in an old straw hat and mens coveralls but after her five oclock bath she would appear on the porch and reign over the street in magisterial beauty
62,she loved everything that grew in gods earth even the weeds
18,with one exception
321,if she found a blade of nut grass in her yard it was like the second battle of the marne she swooped down upon it with a tin tub and subjected it to blasts from beneath with a poisonous substance she said was so powerful itd kill us all if we didnt stand out of the way
29,why cant you just pull it up
91, i asked after witnessing a prolonged campaign against a blade not three inches high
29,pull it up child pull it up
77, she picked up the limp sprout and squeezed her thumb up its tiny stalk
28,microscopic grains oozed out
48,why one sprig of nut grass can ruin a whole yard
85,when it comes fall this dries up and the wind blows it all over maycomb county
84, miss maudies face likened such an occurrence unto an old testament pestilence
58,her speech was crisp for a maycomb county inhabitant
126,she called us by all our names and when she grinned she revealed two minute gold prongs clipped to her eyeteeth
82,when i admired them and hoped i would have some eventually she said look here
123, with a click of her tongue she thrust out her bridgework a gesture of cordiality that cemented our friendship
191,miss maudies benevolence extended to jem and dill whenever they paused in their pursuits we reaped the benefits of a talent miss maudie had hitherto kept hidden from us
48,she made the best cakes in the neighborhood
218,when she was admitted into our confidence every time she baked she made a big cake and three little ones and she would call across the street jem finch scout finch charles baker harris come here
36, our promptness was always rewarded
48,in summertime twilights are long and peaceful
256,often as not miss maudie and i would sit silently on her porch watching the sky go from yellow to pink as the sun went down watching flights of martins sweep low over the neighborhood and disappear behind the schoolhouse rooftops
70,miss maudie i said one evening do you think boo radleys still alive
44, his names arthur and hes alive she said
44,she was rocking slowly in her big oak chair
23,do you smell my mimosa
38,its like angels breath this evening
15,how do you know
16, know what child
31, that b mr arthurs still alive
24, what a morbid question
35,but i suppose its a morbid subject
77,i know hes alive jean louise because i havent seen him carried out yet
55, maybe he died and they stuffed him up the chimney
36, where did you get such a notion
44, thats what jem said he thought they did
35,he gets more like jack finch every day
87, miss maudie had known uncle jack finch atticuss brother since they were children
75,nearly the same age they had grown up together at finchs landing
77,miss maudie was the daughter of a neighboring landowner dr frank buford
118,dr bufords profession was medicine and his obsession was anything that grew in the ground so he stayed poor
112,uncle jack finch confined his passion for digging to his window boxes in nashville and stayed rich
130,we saw uncle jack every christmas and every christmas he yelled across the street for miss maudie to come marry him
128,miss maudie would yell back call a little louder jack finch and theyll hear you at the post office i havent heard you yet
119, jem and i thought this a strange way to ask for a ladys hand in marriage but then uncle jack was rather strange
355,he said he was trying to get miss maudies goat that he had been trying unsuccessfully for forty years that he was the last person in the world miss maudie would think about marrying but the first person she thought about teasing and the best defense to her was spirited offense all of which we understood clearly
71,arthur radley just stays in the house thats all said miss maudie
60,wouldnt you stay in the house if you didnt want to come out
32, yessum but id wanta come out
13,why doesnt he
29, miss maudies eyes narrowed
37,you know that story as well as i do
27, i never heard why though
24,nobody ever told me why
36, miss maudie settled her bridgework
86,you know old mr radley was a foot washing baptist thats what you are aint it
30, my shells not that hard child
16,im just a baptist
38, dont you all believe in footwashing
26,at home in the bathtub
245, but we cant have communion with you all apparently deciding that it was easier to define primitive baptistry than closed communion miss maudie said footwashers believe anything thats pleasure is a sin
154,did you know some of em came out of the woods one saturday and passed by this place and told me me and my flowers were going to hell
18, your flowers too
25,theyd burn right with me
114,they thought i spent too much time in gods outdoors and not enough time inside the house reading the bible
126, my confidence in pulpit gospel lessened at the vision of miss maudie stewing forever in various protestant hells
148,true enough she had an acid tongue in her head and she did not go about the neighborhood doing good as did miss stephanie crawford
119,but while no one with a grain of sense trusted miss stephanie jem and i had considerable faith in miss maudie
120,she had never told on us had never played catandmouse with us she was not at all interested in our private lives
19,she was our friend
100,how so reasonable a creature could live in peril of everlasting torment was incomprehensible
27,that aint right miss maudie
30,youre the best lady i know
21, miss maudie grinned
12,thank you maam
60,thing is footwashers think women are a sin by definition
40,they take the bible literally you know
71, is that why mr arthur stays in the house to keep away from women
13, ive no idea
26, it doesnt make sense to me
89,looks like if mr arthur was hankerin after heaven hed come out on the porch at least
116,atticus says gods loving folks like you love yourself miss maudie stopped rocking and her voice hardened
175,you are too young to understand it she said but sometimes the bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whiskey bottle in the hand of  oh of your father
14, i was shocked
39,atticus doesnt drink whiskey i said
55,he never drunk a drop in his life  nome yes he did
51,he said he drank some one time and didnt like it
21, miss maudie laughed
37,wasnt talking about your father she said
125,what i meant was if atticus finch drank until he was drunk he wouldnt be as hard as some men are at their best
203,there are just some kind of men who  who re so busy worrying about the next world theyve never learned to live in this one and you can look down the street and see the results
71, do you think theyre true all those things they say about b  mr
11, what things
11, i told her
94,that is threefourths colored folks and onefourth stephanie crawford said miss maudie grimly
133,stephanie crawford even told me once she woke up in the middle of the night and found him looking in the window at her
80,i said what did you do stephanie move over in the bed and make room for him
27,that shut her up a while
22, i was sure it did
57,miss maudie s voice was enough to shut anybody up
40,no child she said that is a sad house
46,i remember arthur radley when he was a boy
70,he always spoke nicely to me no matter what folks said he did
30,spoke as nicely as he knew how
23, you reckon hes crazy
29, miss maudie shook her head
33,if hes not he should be by now
61,the things that happen to people we never really know
209,what happens in houses behind closed doors what secrets atticus dont ever do anything to jem and me in the house that he dont do in the yard i said feeling it my duty to defend my parent
198,gracious child i was raveling a thread wasnt even thinking about your father but now that i am ill say this atticus finch is the same in his house as he is on the public streets
47,howd you like some fresh poundcake to take home
21, i liked it very much
100,next morning when i awakened i found jem and dill in the back yard deep in conversation
45,when i joined them as usual they said go away
51,this yards as much mine as it is yours jem finch
56,i got just as much right to play in it as you have
110, dill and jem emerged from a brief huddle if you stay youve got to do what we tell you dill warned
49,we i said whos so high and mighty all of a sudden
95, if you dont say youll do what we tell you we aint gonna tell you anything dill continued
49,you act like you grew ten inches in the night
21,all right what is it
65, jem said placidly we are going to give a note to boo radley
65, i was trying to fight down the automatic terror rising in me
87,it was all right for miss maudie to talk  she was old and snug on her porch
25,it was different for us
110,jem was merely going to put the note on the end of a fishing pole and stick it through the shutters
54,if anyone came along dill would ring the bell
28,dill raised his right hand
42,in it was my mothers silver dinnerbell
56,im goin around to the side of the house said jem
74,we looked yesterday from across the street and theres a shutter loose
64,think maybe i can make it stick on the window sill at least
87, jem now youre in it and you cant get out of it youll just stay in it miss priss
35, okay okay but i dont wanta watch
182,jem somebody was yes you will youll watch the back end of the lot and dills gonna watch the front of the house an up the street an if anybody comes hell ring the bell
16, all right then
19,whatd you write him
168, dill said were askin him real politely to come out sometimes and tell us what he does in there  we said we wouldnt hurt him and wed buy him an ice cream
37, you allve gone crazy hell kill us
22, dill said its my idea
81,i figure if hed come out and sit a spell with us he might feel better
36, how do you know he dont feel good
97, well howd you feel if youd been shut up for a hundred years with nothin but cats to eat
56,i bet hes got a beard down to here like your daddys
69, he aint got a beard he dill stopped as if trying to remember
19,uh huh caughtcha i said
132,you said fore you were off the train good your daddy had a black beard if its all the same to you he shaved it off last summer
72,yeah an ive got the letter to prove it  he sent me two dollars too
68, keep on  i reckon he even sent you a mounted police uniform
26,thatn never showed up did it
90,you just keep on tellin em son dill harris could tell the biggest ones i ever heard
203,among other things he had been up in a mail plane seventeen times he had been to nova scotia he had seen an elephant and his granddaddy was brigadier general joe wheeler and left him his sword
22,you all hush said jem
76,he scuttled beneath the house and came out with a yellow bamboo pole
59,reckon this is long enough to reach from the sidewalk
104, anybody whos brave enough to go up and touch the house hadnt oughta use a fishin pole i said
46,why dont you just knock the front door down
75, this  is  different said jem how many times do i have to tell you that
69, dill took a piece of paper from his pocket and gave it to jem
65,the three of us walked cautiously toward the old house
164,dill remained at the lightpole on the front corner of the lot and jem and i edged down the sidewalk parallel to the side of the house
67,i walked beyond jem and stood where i could see around the curve
17,all clear i said
20,not a soul in sight
51, jem looked up the sidewalk to dill who nodded
156,jem attached the note to the end of the fishing pole let the pole out across the yard and pushed it toward the window he had selected
94,the pole lacked several inches of being long enough and jem leaned over as far as he could
94,i watched him making jabbing motions for so long i abandoned my post and went to him
85,cant get it off the pole he muttered or if i got it off i cant make it stay
33,gon back down the street scout
58, i returned and gazed around the curve at the empty road
111,occasionally i looked back at jem who was patiently trying to place the note on the window sill
146,it would flutter to the ground and jem would jab it up until i thought if boo radley ever received it he wouldnt be able to read it
59,i was looking down the street when the dinnerbell rang
146,shoulder up i reeled around to face boo radley and his bloody fangs instead i saw dill ringing the bell with all his might in atticuss face
73,jem looked so awful i didnt have the heart to tell him i told him so
73,he trudged along dragging the pole behind him on the sidewalk
37,atticus said stop ringing that bell
95, dill grabbed the clapper in the silence that followed i wished hed start ringing it again
91,atticus pushed his hat to the back of his head and put his hands on his hips
34,jem he said what were you doing
10, nothin sir
21, i dont want any of that
55, i was  we were just tryin to give somethin to mr
33, what were you trying to give him
14, just a letter
14, let me see it
38, jem held out a filthy piece of paper
39,atticus took it and tried to read it
35,why do you want mr radley to come out
53, dill said we thought he might enjoy us
43, and dried up when atticus looked at him
103,son he said to jem im going to tell you something and tell you one time stop tormenting that man
36,that goes for the other two of you
41, what mr radley did was his own business
33,if he wanted to come out he would
189,if he wanted to stay inside his own house he had the right to stay inside free from the attentions of inquisitive children which was a mild term for the likes of us
111,how would we like it if atticus barged in on us without knocking when we were in our rooms at night
55,we were in effect doing the same thing to mr radley
87,what mr radley did might seem peculiar to us but it did not seem peculiar to him
159,furthermore had it never occurred to us that the civil way to communicate with another being was by the front door instead of a side window
329,lastly we were to stay away from that house until we were invited there we were not to play an asinine game he had seen us playing or make fun of anybody on this street or in this town we werent makin fun of him we werent laughin at him said jem we were just so that was what you were doing wasnt it
18, makin fun of him
97, no said atticus putting his lifes history on display for the edification of the neighborhood
29, jem seemed to swell a little
46,i didnt say we were doin that i didnt say it
24, atticus grinned dryly
25,you just told me he said
51,you stop this nonsense right now every one of you
17, jem gaped at him
33,you want to be a lawyer dont you
89, our fathers mouth was suspiciously firm as if he were trying to hold it in line
62,jem decided there was no point in quibbling and was silent
199,when atticus went inside the house to retrieve a file he had forgotten to take to work that morning jem finally realized that he had been done in by the oldest lawyers trick on record
116,he waited a respectful distance from the front steps watched atticus leave the house and walk toward town
137,when atticus was out of earshot jem yelled after him i thought i wanted to be a lawyer but i aint so sure now
201,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  yes said our father when jem asked him if we could go over and sit by miss rachels fishpool with dill as this was his last night in maycomb
52,tell him so long for me and well see him next summer
84, we leaped over the low wall that separated miss rachels yard from our driveway
59,jem whistled bobwhite and dill answered in the darkness
32,not a breath blowing said jem
12,looka yonder
23, he pointed to the east
60,a gigantic moon was rising behind miss maudies pecan trees
34,that makes it seem hotter he said
19,cross in it tonight
28, asked dill not looking up
64,he was constructing a cigarette from newspaper and string
16,no just the lady
74,dont light that thing dill youll stink up this whole end of town
42, there was a lady in the moon in maycomb
45,she sat at a dresser combing her hair
33,were gonna miss you boy i said
32,reckon we better watch for mr
86, mr avery boarded across the street from mrs henry lafayette duboses house
145,besides making change in the collection plate every sunday mr avery sat on the porch every night until nine oclock and sneezed
170,one evening we were privileged to witness a performance by him which seemed to have been his positively last for he never did it again so long as we watched
105,jem and i were leaving miss rachels front steps one night when dill stopped us golly looka yonder
26, he pointed across the street
252,at first we saw nothing but a kudzucovered front porch but a closer inspection revealed an arc of water descending from the leaves and splashing in the yellow circle of the street light some ten feet from source to earth it seemed to us
247,jem said mr avery misfigured dill said he must drink a gallon a day and the ensuing contest to determine relative distances and respective prowess only made me feel left out again as i was untalented in this area
58,dill stretched yawned and said altogether too casually
30,i know what lets go for a walk
25, he sounded fishy to me
41,nobody in maycomb just went for a walk
11,where to dill
50, dill jerked his head in a southerly direction
12,jem said okay
81, when i protested he said sweetly you dont have to come along angel may
21, you dont have to go
167,remember jem was not one to dwell on past defeats it seemed the only message he got from atticus was insight into the art of cross examination
78,scout we aint gonna do anything were just goin to the street light and back
196, we strolled silently down the sidewalk listening to porch swings creaking with the weight of the neighborhood listening to the soft nightmurmurs of the grown people on our street
58,occasionally we heard miss stephanie crawford laugh
13,okay said jem
29,why dont you go on home scout
23, what are you gonna do
258, dill and jem were simply going to peep in the window with the loose shutter to see if they could get a look at boo radley and if i didnt want to go with them i could go straight home and keep my fat flopping mouth shut that was all
58,but what in the sam holy hill did you wait till tonight
327, because nobody could see them at night because atticus would be so deep in a book he wouldnt hear the kingdom coming because if boo radley killed them theyd miss school instead of vacation and because it was easier to see inside a dark house in the dark than in the daytime did i understand
155,jem please   scout im tellin you for the last time shut your trap or go home  i declare to the lord youre gettin more like a girl every day
48, with that i had no option but to join them
131,we thought it was better to go under the high wire fence at the rear of the radley lot we stood less chance of being seen
69,the fence enclosed a large garden and a narrow wooden outhouse
56,jem held up the bottom wire and motioned dill under it
40,i followed and held up the wire for jem
34,it was a tight squeeze for him
32,dont make a sound he whispered
73,dont get in a row of collards whatever you do theyll wake the dead
72, with this thought in mind i made perhaps one step per minute
75,i moved faster when i saw jem far ahead beckoning in the moonlight
71,we came to the gate that divided the garden from the back yard
14,jem touched it
17,the gate squeaked
27,spit on it whispered dill
36,youve got us in a box jem i muttered
35,we cant get out of here so easy
16,spit on it scout
116, we spat ourselves dry and jem opened the gate slowly lifting it aside and resting it on the fence
24,we were in the back yard
183,the back of the radley house was less inviting than the front a ramshackle porch ran the width of the house there were two doors and two dark windows between the doors
71,instead of a column a rough twobyfour supported one end of the roof
122,an old franklin stove sat in a corner of the porch above it a hatrack mirror caught the moon and shone eerily
41,arr said jem softly lifting his foot
22, chickens he breathed
140,that we would be obliged to dodge the unseen from all directions was confirmed when dill ahead of us spelled god in a whisper
90,we crept to the side of the house around to the window with the hanging shutter
48,the sill was several inches taller than jem
42,give you a hand up he muttered to dill
11,wait though
142, jem grabbed his left wrist and my right wrist i grabbed my left wrist and jems right wrist we crouched and dill sat on our saddle
47,we raised him and he caught the window sill
46,hurry jem whispered we cant last much longer
64, dill punched my shoulder and we lowered him to the ground
11,whatdyousee
58,theres a little teeny light way off somewhere though
38, lets get away from here breathed jem
30,lets go round in back again
43,shh he warned me as i was about to protest
27,lets try the back window
17, dill no i said
32,dill stopped and let jem go ahead
64,when jem put his foot on the bottom step the step squeaked
51,he stood still then tried his weight by degrees
19,the step was silent
103,jem skipped two steps put his foot on the porch heaved himself to it and teetered a long moment
54,he regained his balance and dropped to his knees
58,he crawled to the window raised his head and looked in
20,then i saw the shadow
43,it was the shadow of a man with a hat on
97,at first i thought it was a tree but there was no wind blowing and treetrunks never walked
118,the back porch was bathed in moonlight and the shadow crisp as toast moved across the porch toward jem
16,dill saw it next
31,he put his hands to his face
31,when it crossed jem jem saw it
48,he put his arms over his head and went rigid
46,the shadow stopped about a foot beyond jem
56,its arm came out from its side dropped and was still
134,then it turned and moved back across jem walked along the porch and off the side of the house returning as it had come
50,jem leaped off the porch and galloped toward us
107,he flung open the gate danced dill and me through and shooed us between two rows of swishing collards
106,halfway through the collards i tripped as i tripped the roar of a shotgun shattered the neighborhood
29,dill and jem dived beside me
51,jems breath came in sobs fence by the schoolyard
12, hurry scout
173, jem held the bottom wire dill and i rolled through and were halfway to the shelter of the schoolyards solitary oak when we sensed that jem was not with us
95,we ran back and found him struggling in the fence kicking his pants off to get loose
38,he ran to the oak tree in his shorts
109,safely behind it we gave way to numbness but jems mind was racing we gotta get home theyll miss us
195, we ran across the schoolyard crawled under the fence to deers pasture behind our house climbed our back fence and were at the back steps before jem would let us pause to rest
99,respiration normal the three of us strolled as casually as we could to the front yard
90,we looked down the street and saw a circle of neighbors at the radley front gate
32,we better go down there said jem
46,theyll think its funny if we dont show up
92, mr nathan radley was standing inside his gate a shotgun broken across his arm
72,atticus was standing beside miss maudie and miss stephanie crawford
38,miss rachel and mr avery were near by
27,none of them saw us come up
47,we eased in beside miss maudie who looked around
57,where were you all didnt you hear the commotion
15, what happened
50,mr radley shot at a negro in his collard patch
14,did he hit him
25, no said miss stephanie
14,shot in the air
22,scared him pale though
61,says if anybody sees a white nigger around thats the one
152,says hes got the other barrel waitin for the next sound he hears in that patch an next time he wont aim high be it dog nigger or  jem finch
13,atticus spoke
21,wherere your pants son
16, it was no use
40,in his shorts before god and everybody
149, in the glare from the streetlight i could see dill hatching one his eyes widened his fat cherub face grew rounder
14,what is it dill
13, asked atticus
40,ah  i won em from him he said vaguely
39, dills hand sought the back of his head
47,he brought it forward and across his forehead
67,we were playin strip poker up yonder by the fishpool he said
18,jem and i relaxed
57,the neighbors seemed satisfied they all stiffened
24,but what was strip poker
106,we had no chance to find out miss rachel went off like the town fire siren do oo jeesus dill harris
23,gamblin by my fishpool
24,ill strippoker you sir
51, atticus saved dill from immediate dismemberment
36,just a minute miss rachel he said
43,ive never heard of em doing that before
27,were you all playing cards
69, jem fielded dills fly with his eyes shut no sir just with matches
22, i admired my brother
47,matches were dangerous but cards were fatal
74,jem scout said atticus i dont want to hear of poker in any form again
38,go by dills and get your pants jem
20,settle it yourselves
89, dont worry dill said jem as we trotted up the sidewalk she aint gonna get you
23,hell talk her out of it
27,that was fast thinkin son
37, we stopped and heard atticuss voice
11,not serious
87,they all go through it miss rachel dill was comforted but jem and i werent
72,there was the problem of jem showing up some pants in the morning
71,d give you some of mine said dill as we came to miss rachels steps
52,jem said he couldnt get in them but thanks anyway
52,we said goodbye and dill went inside the house
110,he evidently remembered he was engaged to me for he ran back out and kissed me swiftly in front of jem
15,yawl write hear
20, he bawled after us
77,had jems pants been safely on him we would not have slept much anyway
431,every nightsound i heard from my cot on the back porch was magnified three fold every scratch of feet on gravel was boo radley seeking revenge every passing negro laughing in the night was boo radley loose and after us insects splashing against the screen were boo radleys insane fingers picking the wire to pieces the chinaberry trees were malignant hovering alive
74,i lingered between sleep and wakefulness until i heard jem murmur
23,sleep little threeeyes
14, are you crazy
24, shh atticuss lights out
65, in the waning moonlight i saw jem swing his feet to the floor
25,im goin after em he said
13,i sat upright
15,i wont let you
38, he was struggling into his shirt
32, you do an ill wake up atticus
25, you do and ill kill you
43, i pulled him down beside me on the cot
26,i tried to reason with him
44,mr nathans gonna find em in the morning jem
19,he knows you lost em
82,when he shows em to atticus itll be pretty bad thats all there is to it
14,gon back to bed
26, thats what i know said jem
26,thats why im goin after em
21, i began to feel sick
172,going back to that place by himself  i remembered miss stephanie mr nathan had the other barrel waiting for the next sound he heard be it nigger dog
74,jem knew that better than i i was desperate look it aint worth it jem
32,a lickin hurts but it doesnt last
39,youll get your head shot off jem
33, he blew out his breath patiently
32,i  its like this scout he muttered
52,atticus aint ever whipped me since i can remember
23,i wanta keep it that way
21, this was a thought
55,it seemed that atticus threatened us every other day
44,you mean hes never caught you at anything
52, maybe so but  i just wanta keep it that way scout
35,we shouldna done that tonight scout
72, it was then i suppose that jem and i first began to part company
88,sometimes i did not understand him but my periods of bewilderment were shortlived
18,this was beyond me
105,please i pleaded cantcha just think about it for a minute  by yourself on that place   shut up
57, its not like hed never speak to you again or somethin 
99,im gonna wake him up jem i swear i am   jem grabbed my pajama collar and wrenched it tight
33,then im goin with you   i choked
39,no you aint youll just make noise
13, it was no use
76,i unlatched the back door and held it while he crept down the steps
29,it must have been two oclock
88,the moon was setting and the latticework shadows were fading into fuzzy nothingness
118,jems white shirttail dipped and bobbed like a small ghost dancing away to escape the coming morning
68,a faint breeze stirred and cooled the sweat running down my sides
153,he went the back way through deers pasture across the schoolyard and around to the fence i thought  at least that was the way he was headed
50,it would take longer so it was not time to worry yet
80,i waited until it was time to worry and listened for mr radleys shotgun
47,then i thought i heard the back fence squeak
24,it was wishful thinking
26,then i heard atticus cough
16,i held my breath
91,sometimes when we made a midnight pilgrimage to the bathroom we would find him reading
94,he said he often woke up during the night checked on us and read himself back to sleep
79,i waited for his light to go on straining my eyes to see it flood the hall
37,it stayed off and i breathed again
173,the nightcrawlers had retired but ripe chinaberries drummed on the roof when the wind stirred and the darkness was desolate with the barking of distant dogs
27,there he was returning to me
69,his white shirt bobbed over the back fence and slowly grew larger
75,he came up the back steps latched the door behind him and sat on his cot
31,wordlessly he held up his pants
59,he lay down and for a while i heard his cot trembling
18,soon he was still
31,i did not hear him stir again
75,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  jem stayed moody and silent for a week
225,as atticus had once advised me to do i tried to climb into jems skin and walk around in it if i had gone alone to the radley place at two in the morning my funeral would have been held the next afternoon
57,so i left jem alone and tried not to bother him
13,school started
133,the second grade was as bad as the first only worse  they still flashed cards at you and wouldnt let you read or write
182,miss carolines progress next door could be estimated by the frequency of laughter however the usual crew had flunked the first grade again and were helpful in keeping order
162,the only thing good about the second grade was that this year i had to stay as late as jem and we usually walked home together at three oclock
123,one afternoon when we were crossing the schoolyard toward home jem suddenly said theres something i didnt tell you
97, as this was his first complete sentence in several days i encouraged him about what
18, about that night
57, youve never told me anything about that night i said
46,jem waved my words away as if fanning gnats
168,he was silent for a while then he said when i went back for my breeches  they were all in a tangle when i was gettin out of em i couldnt get em loose
45,when i went back   jem took a deep breath
54,when i went back they were folded across the fence
27,like they were expectin me
50, across and something else   jems voice was flat
26,show you when we get home
20,theyd been sewed up
53,not like a lady sewed em like somethin id try to do
11,all crooked
67,its almost like     somebody knew you were comin back for em
14, jem shuddered
83,like somebody was readin my mind like somebody could tell what i was gonna do
68,cant anybody tell what im gonna do lest they know me can they scout
27, jems question was an appeal
133,i reassured him cant anybody tell what youre gonna do lest they live in the house with you and even i cant tell sometimes
31, we were walking past our tree
47,in its knothole rested a ball of gray twine
22,dont take it jem i said
31,this is somebodys hidin place
22, i dont think so scout
137,somebody like walter cunningham comes down here every recess and hides his things  and we come along and take em away from him
48,listen lets leave it and wait a couple of days
39,if it aint gone then well take it okay
41, okay you might be right said jem
76,it must be some little kids place  hides his things from the bigger folks
62,you know its only when schools in that weve found things
59, yeah i said but we never go by here in the summertime
13, we went home
51,next morning the twine was where we had left it
62,when it was still there on the third day jem pocketed it
82,from then on we considered everything we found in the knothole our property
240, the second grade was grim but jem assured me that the older i got the better school would be that he started off the same way and it was not until one reached the sixth grade that one learned anything of value
271,the sixth grade seemed to please him from the beginning he went through a brief egyptian period that baffled me  he tried to walk flat a great deal sticking one arm in front of him and one in back of him putting one foot behind the other
284,he declared egyptians walked that way i said if they did i didnt see how they got anything done but jem said they accomplished more than the americans ever did they invented toilet paper and perpetual embalming and asked where would we be today if they hadnt
66,atticus told me to delete the adjectives and id have the facts
209,there are no clearly defined seasons in south alabama summer drifts into autumn and autumn is sometimes never followed by winter but turns to a days old spring that melts into summer again
69,that fall was a long one hardly cool enough for a light jacket
113,jem and i were trotting in our orbit one mild october afternoon when our knothole stopped us again
38,something white was inside this time
77,jem let me do the honors i pulled out two small images carved in soap
60,one was the figure of a boy the other wore a crude dress
102,before i remembered that there was no such thing as hoodooing i shrieked and threw them down
21,jem snatched them up
27,whats the matter with you
41,he rubbed the figures free of red dust
24,these are good he said
30,ive never seen any these good
25, he held them down to me
53,they were almost perfect miniatures of two children
74,the boy had on shorts and a shock of soapy hair fell to his eyebrows
18,i looked up at jem
67,a point of straight brown hair kicked downwards from his part
29,i had never noticed it before
40,jem looked from the girldoll to me
23,the girldoll wore bangs
21,these are us he said
22,who did em you reckon
41, who do we know around here who whittles
30, mr avery just does like this
12,i mean carves
108, mr avery averaged a stick of stovewood per week he honed it down to a toothpick and chewed it
59,theres old miss stephanie crawfords sweetheart i said
55,he carves all right but he lives down the country
44,when would he ever pay any attention to us
75, maybe he sits on the porch and looks at us instead of miss stephanie
20,if i was him i would
98, jem stared at me so long i asked what was the matter but got nothing scout for an answer
57,when we went home jem put the dolls in his trunk
188,less than two weeks later we found a whole package of chewing gum which we enjoyed the fact that everything on the radley place was poison having slipped jems memory
59,the following week the knothole yielded a tarnished medal
196,jem showed it to atticus who said it was a spelling medal that before we were born the maycomb county schools had spelling contests and awarded medals to the winners
64,atticus said someone must have lost it and had we asked around
63,jem camelkicked me when i tried to say where we had found it
83,jem asked atticus if he remembered anybody who ever won one and atticus said no
44,our biggest prize appeared four days later
78,it was a pocket watch that wouldnt run on a chain with an aluminum knife
31,you reckon its white gold jem
22,ill show it to atticus
90, atticus said it would probably be worth ten dollars knife chain and all if it were new
40,did you swap with somebody at school
129, jem pulled out his grandfathers watch that atticus let him carry once a week if jem were careful with it
58,on the days he carried the watch jem walked on eggs
67,atticus if its all right with you id rather have this one instead
18,maybe i can fix it
188, when the new wore off his grandfathers watch and carrying it became a days burdensome task jem no longer felt the necessity of ascertaining the hour every five minutes
100,he did a fair job only one spring and two tiny pieces left over but the watch would not run
25,ohh he sighed itll never go
79, you reckon we oughta write a letter to whoever s leaving us these things
57, thatd be right nice jem we can thank em  whats wrong
65, jem was holding his ears shaking his head from side to side
59,i dont get it i just dont get it  i dont know why scout
31, he looked toward the livingroom
54,ive gotta good mind to tell atticus  no i reckon not
21, ill tell him for you
22, no dont do that scout
157, he had been on the verge of telling me something all evening his face would brighten and he would lean toward me then he would change his mind
20,he changed it again
27, here lets write a letter
45, i pushed a tablet and pencil under his nose
37,dear mister how do you know its a man
61,i bet its miss maudie  been bettin that for a long time
59, arr miss maudie cant chew gum   jem broke into a grin
46,you know she can talk real pretty sometimes
165,one time i asked her to have a chew and she said no thanks that  chewing gum cleaved to her palate and rendered her speechless said jem carefully
23,doesnt that sound nice
38, yeah she can say nice things sometimes
43,she wouldnt have a watch and chain anyway
16, dear sir said jem
93,we appreciate the  no we appreciate everything which you have put into the tree for us
38,yours very truly jeremy atticus finch
57, he wont know who you are if you sign it like that jem
43, jem erased his name and wrote jem finch
48, i signed jean louise finch scout beneath it
32,jem put the note in an envelope
87,next morning on the way to school he ran ahead of me and stopped at the tree
70,jem was facing me when he looked up and i saw him go stark white
12, i ran to him
50,someone had filled our knothole with cement
23,dont you cry now scout
76,dont cry now dont you worry he muttered at me all the way to school
97,when we went home for dinner jem bolted his food ran to the porch and stood on the steps
15,i followed him
31,hasnt passed by yet he said
50,next day jem repeated his vigil and was rewarded
27,hidy do mr nathan he said
50,morning jem scout said mr radley as he went by
19,mr radley said jem
26,mr radley turned around
81,mr radley ah  did you put cement in that hole in that tree down yonder
12, yes he said
17,i filled it up
16, whydyoudoit sir
13, trees dying
43,you plug em with cement when theyre sick
25,you ought to know that jem
55, jem said nothing more about it until late afternoon
104,when we passed our tree he gave it a meditative pat on its cement and remained deep in thought
78,he seemed to be working himself into a bad humor so i kept my distance
64,as usual we met atticus coming home from work that evening
88,when we were at our steps jem said atticus look down yonder at that tree please sir
12, what tree son
63, the one on the corner of the radley lot comin from school
18, is that tree dyin
27, why no son i dont think so
102,look at the leaves theyre all green and full no brown patches anywhere   it aint even sick
38, that trees as healthy as you are jem
36, mr nathan radley said it was dyin
18, well maybe it is
57,im sure mr radley knows more about his trees than we do
31, atticus left us on the porch
58,jem leaned on a pillar rubbing his shoulders against it
15,do you itch jem
30, i asked as politely as i could
18,he did not answer
23,come on in jem i said
10,after while
55, he stood there until nightfall and i waited for him
157,when we went in the house i saw he had been crying his face was dirty in the right places but i thought it odd that i had not heard him
161,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  for reasons unfathomable to the most experienced prophets in maycomb county autumn turned to winter that year
63,we had two weeks of the coldest weather since  atticus said
365,mr avery said it was written on the rosetta stone that when children disobeyed their parents smoked cigarettes and made war on each other the seasons would change jem and i were burdened with the guilt of contributing to the aberrations of nature thereby causing unhappiness to our neighbors and discomfort to ourselves
155,old mrs radley died that winter but her death caused hardly a ripple  the neighborhood seldom saw her except when she watered her carinas
165,jem and i decided that boo had got her at last but when atticus returned from the radley house he said she died of natural causes to our disappointment
22,ask him jem whispered
30,you ask him youre the oldest
31, thats why you oughta ask him
33, atticus i said did you see mr
66, atticus looked sternly around his newspaper at me i did not
44, jem restrained me from further questions
103,he said atticus was still touchous about us and the radleys and it wouldnt do to push him any
126,jem had a notion that atticus thought our activities that night last summer were not solely confined to strip poker
72,jem had no firm basis for his ideas he said it was merely a twitch
75,next morning i awoke looked out the window and nearly died of fright
57,my screams brought atticus from his bathroom halfshaven
24,the worlds endin atticus
20,please do something  
43, i dragged him to the window and pointed
20,no its not he said
11,its snowing
36, jem asked atticus would it keep up
56,jem had never seen snow either but he knew what it was
64,atticus said he didnt know any more about snow than jem did
64,i think though if its watery like that itll turn to rain
76, the telephone rang and atticus left the breakfast table to answer it
48,that was eula may he said when he returned
89,i quote  as it has not snowed in maycomb county since  there will be no school today
52, eula may was maycomb s leading telephone operator
173,she was entrusted with issuing public announcements wedding invitations setting off the fire siren and giving firstaid instructions when dr reynolds was away
151,when atticus finally called us to order and bade us look at our plates instead of out the windows jem asked how do you make a snowman
44, i havent the slightest idea said atticus
105,i dont want you all to be disappointed but i doubt if therell be enough snow for a snowball even
63, calpurnia came in and said she thought it was sticking
89,when we ran to the back yard it was covered with a feeble layer of soggy snow
41,we shouldnt walk about in it said jem
39,look every step you takes wasting it
37, i looked back at my mushy footprints
97,jem said if we waited until it snowed some more we could scrape it all up for a snowman
48,i stuck out my tongue and caught a fat flake
12,jem its hot
35, no it aint its so cold it burns
39,now dont eat it scout youre wasting it
18,let it come down
25, but i want to walk in it
48, i know what we can go walk over at miss maudies
36, jem hopped across the front yard
23,i followed in his tracks
88,when we were on the sidewalk in front of miss maudies mr avery accosted us
52,he had a pink face and a big stomach below his belt
19,see what youve done
44,hasnt snowed in maycomb since appomattox
53,its bad children like you makes the seasons change
192, i wondered if mr avery knew how hopefully we had watched last summer for him to repeat his performance and reflected that if this was our reward there was something to say for sin
121,i did not wonder where mr avery gathered his meteorological statistics they came straight from the rosetta stone
24,jem finch you jem finch
27, miss maudies callin you jem
41, you all stay in the middle of the yard
59,theres some thrift buried under the snow near the porch
13,dont step on it
11, called jem
35,its beautiful aint it miss maudie
24, beautiful my hind foot
56,if it freezes tonight itll carry off all my azaleas
60, miss maudies old sunhat glistened with snow crystals
69,she was bending over some small bushes wrapping them in burlap bags
45,jem asked her what she was doing that for
22,keep em warm she said
27,how can flowers keep warm
20,they dont circulate
42, i cannot answer that question jem finch
93,all i know is if it freezes tonight these plantsll freeze so you cover em up
13,is that clear
10,miss maudie
47, could scout and me borrow some of your snow
28, heavens alive take it all
69,theres an old peach basket under the house haul it off in that
27, miss maudies eyes narrowed
57,jem finch what are you going to do with my snow
124, youll see said jem and we transferred as much snow as we could from miss maudies yard to ours a slushy operation
26,what are we gonna do jem
18,youll see he said
97,now get the basket and haul all the snow you can rake up from the back yard to the front
47,walk back in your tracks though he cautioned
34,are we gonna have a snow baby jem
18, no a real snowman
19,gotta work hard now
152, jem ran to the back yard produced the garden hoe and began digging quickly behind the woodpile placing any worms he found to one side
115,he went in the house returned with the laundry hamper filled it with earth and carried it to the front yard
104,when we had five baskets of earth and two baskets of snow jem said we were ready to begin
38,dont you think this is kind of a mess
44,looks messy now but it wont later he said
141,jem scooped up an armful of dirt patted it into a mound on which he added another load and another until he had constructed a torso
50,jem i aint ever heard of a nigger snowman i said
33,he wont be black long he grunted
133,jem procured some peachtree switches from the back yard plaited them and bent them into bones to be covered with dirt
68,he looks like stephanie crawford with her hands on her hips i said
40,fat in the middle and littlebitty arms
19, ill make em bigger
62, jem sloshed water over the mud man and added more dirt
113,he looked thoughtfully at it for a moment then he molded a big stomach below the figures waistline
87,jem glanced at me his eyes twinkling mr averys sort of shaped like a snowman aint he
56, jem scooped up some snow and began plastering it on
81,he permitted me to cover only the back saving the public parts for himself
32,gradually mr avery turned white
99,using bits of wood for eyes nose mouth and buttons jem succeeded in making mr avery look cross
45,a stick of stovewood completed the picture
40,jem stepped back and viewed his creation
21,its lovely jem i said
36,looks almost like hed talk to you
15, it is aint it
14, he said shyly
107,we could not wait for atticus to come home for dinner but called and said we had a big surprise for him
128,he seemed surprised when he saw most of the back yard in the front yard but he said we had done a jimdandy job
159,i didnt know how you were going to do it he said to jem but from now on ill never worry about whatll become of you son youll always have an idea
115, jems ears reddened from atticuss compliment but he looked up sharply when he saw atticus stepping back
42,atticus squinted at the snowman a while
22,he grinned then laughed
86,son i cant tell what youre going to be  an engineer a lawyer or a portrait painter
57,youve perpetrated a near libel here in the front yard
34,weve got to disguise this fellow
132, atticus suggested that jem hone down his creations front a little swap a broom for the stovewood and put an apron on him
94,jem explained that if he did the snowman would become muddy and cease to be a snowman
66,i dont care what you do so long as you do something said atticus
62,you cant go around making caricatures of the neighbors
32, aint a characterture said jem
23,it looks just like him
28, mr avery might not think so
12, i know what
101,he raced across the street disappeared into miss maudies back yard and returned triumphant
102,he stuck her sunhat on the snowmans head and jammed her hedgeclippers into the crook of his arm
32,atticus said that would be fine
67,miss maudie opened her front door and came out on the porch
37,she looked across the street at us
20,suddenly she grinned
21,jem finch she called
36,you devil bring me back my hat sir
46, jem looked up at atticus who shook his head
26,shes just fussing he said
53,shes really impressed with your  accomplishments
153, atticus strolled over to miss maudies sidewalk where they engaged in an arm waving conversation the only phrase of which i caught was 
41,erected an absolute morphodite in that yard
28,atticus youll never raise em
195, the snow stopped in the afternoon the temperature dropped and by nightfall mr averys direst predictions came true calpurnia kept every fireplace in the house blazing but we were cold
132,when atticus came home that evening he said we were in for it and asked calpurnia if she wanted to stay with us for the night
124,calpurnia glanced up at the high ceilings and long windows and said she thought shed be warmer at her house
37,atticus drove her home in the car
68,before i went to sleep atticus put more coal on the fire in my room
145,he said the thermometer registered sixteen that it was the coldest night in his memory and that our snowman outside was frozen solid
65,minutes later it seemed i was awakened by someone shaking me
42,atticus s overcoat was spread across me
23,is it morning already
12, baby get up
49, atticus was holding out my bathrobe and coat
32,put your robe on first he said
46,jem was standing beside atticus groggy and tousled
95,he was holding his overcoat closed at the neck his other hand was jammed into his pocket
33,he looked strangely overweight
21,hurry hon said atticus
26,herere your shoes and socks
23, stupidly i put them on
14,is it morning
28, no its a little after one
54, that something was wrong finally got through to me
16,whats the matter
41, by then he did not have to tell me
107,just as the birds know where to go when it rains i knew when there was trouble in our street
91,soft taffetalike sounds and muffled scurrying sounds filled me with helpless dread
11,whose is it
38, miss maudies hon said atticus gently
74,at the front door we saw fire spewing from miss maudies diningroom windows
133,as if to confirm what we saw the town fire siren wailed up the scale to a treble pitch and remained there screaming
16,its gone aint it
11, moaned jem
25,i expect so said atticus
23,now listen both of you
49,go down and stand in front of the radley place
31,keep out of the way do you hear
30,see which way the winds blowing
13, oh said jem
61,atticus reckon we oughta start moving the furniture out
12, not yet son
15,do as i tell you
29,take care of scout you hear
31,dont let her out of your sight
64, with a push atticus started us toward the radley front gate
112,we stood watching the street fill with men and cars while fire silently devoured miss maudies house
44,why dont they hurry why dont they hurry
14, muttered jem
96,the old fire truck killed by the cold was being pushed from town by a crowd of men
111,when the men attached its hose to a hydrant the hose burst and water shot up tinkling down on the pavement
41,ohh lord jem jem put his arm around me
19,hush scout he said
27,it aint time to worry yet
23,ill let you know when
133, the men of maycomb in all degrees of dress and undress took furniture from miss maudies house to a yard across the street
134,i saw atticus carrying miss maudies heavy oak rocking chair and thought it sensible of him to save what she valued most
27,sometimes we heard shouts
53,then mr averys face appeared in an upstairs window
132,he pushed a mattress out the window into the street and threw down furniture until men shouted come down from there dick
21,the stairs are going
18,get outta there mr
48, mr avery began climbing through the window
15,scout hes stuck
14, breathed jem
26,mr avery was wedged tightly
103,i buried my head under jems arm and didnt look again until jem cried hes got loose scout
12,hes all right
57, i looked up to see mr avery cross the upstairs porch
93,he swung his legs over the railing and was sliding down a pillar when he slipped
49,he fell yelled and hit miss maudies shrubbery
117,suddenly i noticed that the men were backing away from miss maudies house moving down the street toward us
41,they were no longer carrying furniture
142,the fire was well into the second floor and had eaten its way to the roof window frames were black against a vivid orange center
43,jem it looks like a pumpkin   scout look
131, smoke was rolling off our house and miss rachels house like fog off a riverbank and men were pulling hoses toward them
115,behind us the fire truck from abbottsville screamed around the curve and stopped in front of our house
17,that book i said
43,that tom swift book it aint mine its dills
53,dont worry scout it aint time to worry yet said jem
13,looka yonder
88, in a group of neighbors atticus was standing with his hands in his overcoat pockets
44,he might have been watching a football game
28,miss maudie was beside him
41,see there hes not worried yet said jem
41,why aint he on top of one of the houses
31, hes too old hed break his neck
55, you think we oughta make him get our stuff out
59, lets dont pester him hell know when its time said jem
133,the abbottsville fire truck began pumping water on our house a man on the roof pointed to places that needed it most
111,i watched our absolute morphodite go black and crumble miss maudies sunhat settled on top of the heap
35,i could not see her hedgeclippers
113,in the heat between our house miss rachels and miss maudies the men had long ago shed coats and bathrobes
143,they worked in pajama tops and nightshirts stuffed into their pants but i became aware that i was slowly freezing where i stood
60,jem tried to keep me warm but his arm was not enough
47,i pulled free of it and clutched my shoulders
40,by dancing a little i could feel my feet
85,another fire truck appeared and stopped in front of miss stephanie crawfords
111,there was no hydrant for another hose and the men tried to soak her house with hand extinguishers
43,miss maudies tin roof quelled the flames
184,roaring the house collapsed fire gushed everywhere followed by a flurry of blankets from men on top of the adjacent houses beating out sparks and burning chunks of wood
79,it was dawn before the men began to leave first one by one then in groups
114,they pushed the maycomb fire truck back to town the abbottsville truck departed the third one remained
74,we found out next day it had come from clarks ferry sixty miles away
32,jem and i slid across the street
144,miss maudie was staring at the smoking black hole in her yard and atticus shook his head to tell us she did not want to talk
74,he led us home holding onto our shoulders to cross the icy street
74,he said miss maudie would stay with miss stephanie for the time being
33,anybody want some hot chocolate
65,i shuddered when atticus started a fire in the kitchen stove
101,as we drank our cocoa i noticed atticus looking at me first with curiosity then with sternness
56,i thought i told you and jem to stay put he said
38,we stayed then whose blanket is that
17, yes maam blanket
12,it isnt ours
140, i looked down and found myself clutching a brown woolen blanket i was wearing around my shoulders squawfashion
26,atticus i dont know sir
81,i   i turned to jem for an answer but jem was even more bewildered than i
182,he said he didnt know how it got there we did exactly as atticus had told us we stood down by the radley gate away from everybody we didnt move an inch  jem stopped
115,mr nathan was at the fire he babbled i saw him i saw him he was tuggin that mattress  atticus i swear
22, thats all right son
25, atticus grinned slowly
67,looks like all of maycomb was out tonight in one way or another
55,jem theres some wrapping paper in the pantry i think
36,go get it and well   atticus no sir
36, jem seemed to have lost his mind
162,he began pouring out our secrets right and left in total disregard for my safety if not for his own omitting nothing knothole pants and all
310,nathan put cement in that tree atticus an he did it to stop us findin things  hes crazy i reckon like they say but atticus i swear to god he aint ever harmed us he aint ever hurt us he coulda cut my throat from ear to ear that night but he tried to mend my pants instead
100,he aint ever hurt us atticus   atticus said whoa son so gently that i was greatly heartened
98,it was obvious that he had not followed a word jem said for all atticus said was youre right
51,wed better keep this and the blanket to ourselves
59,someday maybe scout can thank him for covering her up
100,you were so busy looking at the fire you didnt know it when he put the blanket around you
112, my stomach turned to water and i nearly threw up when jem held out the blanket and crept toward me
81,he sneaked out of the house  turn round  sneaked up an went like this
76, atticus said dryly do not let this inspire you to further glory jeremy
114, jem scowled i aint gonna do anything to him but i watched the spark of fresh adventure leave his eyes
71,just think scout he said if youd just turned around you da seen him
26, calpurnia woke us at noon
91,atticus had said we need not go to school that day wed learn nothing after no sleep
55,calpurnia said for us to try and clean up the front yard
142,miss maudies sunhat was suspended in a thin layer of ice like a fly in amber and we had to dig under the dirt for her hedgeclippers
72,we found her in her back yard gazing at her frozen charred azaleas
52,were bringing back your things miss maudie said jem
16,were awful sorry
81, miss maudie looked around and the shadow of her old grin crossed her face
39,always wanted a smaller house jem finch
19,gives me more yard
54,just think ill have more room for my azaleas now
32, you aint grievin miss maudie
19, i asked surprised
48,atticus said her house was nearly all she had
15,grieving child
30,why i hated that old cow barn
82,thought of settin fire to it a hundred times myself except theyd lock me up
48, but dont you worry about me jean louise finch
56,there are ways of doing things you dont know about
125,why ill build me a little house and take me a couple of roomers and  gracious ill have the finest yard in alabama
59,those bellingrathsll look plain puny when i get started
35, jem and i looked at each other
24,howd it catch miss maudie
16,i dont know jem
37,probably the flue in the kitchen
60,i kept a fire in there last night for my potted plants
68,hear you had some unexpected company last night miss jean louise
14, howd you know
52, atticus told me on his way to town this morning
51,tell you the truth id like tove been with you
46,and idve had sense enough to turn around too
24, miss maudie puzzled me
145,with most of her possessions gone and her beloved yard a shambles she still took a lively and cordial interest in jems and my affairs
35,she must have seen my perplexity
98,she said only thing i worried about last night was all the danger and commotion it caused
45,this whole neighborhood could have gone up
56,mr averyll be in bed for a week  hes right stove up
52,hes too old to do things like that and i told him so
120,soon as i can get my hands clean and when stephanie crawfords not looking ill make him a lane cake
169,that stephanies been after my recipe for thirty years and if she thinks ill give it to her just because im staying with her shes got another think coming
110, i reflected that if miss maudie broke down and gave it to her miss stephanie couldnt follow it anyway
110,miss maudie had once let me see it among other things the recipe called for one large cup of sugar
18,it was a still day
118,the air was so cold and clear we heard the courthouse clock clank rattle and strain before it struck the hour
84,miss maudie s nose was a color i had never seen before and i inquired about it
44,ive been out here since six oclock she said
24,should be frozen by now
21, she held up her hands
86,a network of tiny lines crisscrossed her palms brown with dirt and dried blood
25,youve ruined em said jem
31,why dont you get a colored man
87, there was no note of sacrifice in his voice when he added or scoutnme we can help you
81, miss maudie said thank you sir but youve got a job of your own over there
26, she pointed to our yard
25,you mean the morphodite
37,shoot we can rake him up in a jiffy
62, miss maudie stared down at me her lips moving silently
52,suddenly she put her hands to her head and whooped
42,when we left her she was still chuckling
87,jem said he didnt know what was the matter with her  that was just miss maudie
65,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  you can just take that back boy
103, this order given by me to cecil jacobs was the beginning of a rather thin time for jem and me
52,my fists were clenched and i was ready to let fly
231,atticus had promised me he would wear me out if he ever heard of me fighting any more i was far too old and too big for such childish things and the sooner i learned to hold in the better off everybody would be
12,i soon forgot
27,cecil jacobs made me forget
98,he had announced in the schoolyard the day before that scout finchs daddy defended niggers
23,i denied it but told jem
26,whatd he mean sayin that
17,nothing jem said
25,ask atticus hell tell you
31, do you defend niggers atticus
24, i asked him that evening
14,of course i do
21,dont say nigger scout
12,thats common
35, s what everybody at school says
135, from now on itll be everybody less one   well if you dont want me to grow up talkin that way why do you send me to school
53, my father looked at me mildly amusement in his eyes
252,despite our compromise my campaign to avoid school had continued in one form or another since my first days dose of it the beginning of last september had brought on sinking spells dizziness and mild gastric complaints
177,i went so far as to pay a nickel for the privilege of rubbing my head against the head of miss rachels cooks son who was afflicted with a tremendous ringworm
14,it didnt take
33,but i was worrying another bone
38,do all lawyers defend nnegroes atticus
25, of course they do scout
47, then why did cecil say you defended niggers
49,he made it sound like you were runnin a still
15, atticus sighed
54,im simply defending a negro  his names tom robinson
54,he lives in that little settlement beyond the town dump
70,hes a member of calpurnias church and cal knows his family well
34,she says theyre cleanliving folks
182,scout you arent old enough to understand some things yet but theres been some high talk around town to the effect that i shouldnt do much about defending this man
68,its a peculiar case  it wont come to trial until summer session
54,john taylor was kind enough to give us a postponement
66, if you shouldnt be defendin him then why are you doin it
40, for a number of reasons said atticus
193,the main one is if i didnt i couldnt hold up my head in town i couldnt represent this county in the legislature i couldnt even tell you or jem not to do something again
98, you mean if you didnt defend that man jem and me wouldnt have to mind you any more
20, thats about right
55, because i could never ask you to mind me again
136,scout simply by the nature of the work every lawyer gets at least one case in his lifetime that affects him personally
25,this ones mine i guess
157,you might hear some ugly talk about it at school but do one thing for me if you will you just hold your head high and keep those fists down
68,no matter what anybody says to you dont you let em get your goat
45,try fighting with your head for a change
47,its a good one even if it does resist learning
33, atticus are we going to win it
140, then why simply because we were licked a hundred years before we started is no reason for us not to try to win atticus said
40,you sound like cousin ike finch i said
76,cousin ike finch was maycomb countys sole surviving confederate veteran
73,he wore a general hood type beard of which he was inordinately vain
89,at least once a year atticus jem and i called on him and i would have to kiss him
14,it was horrible
91,jem and i would listen respectfully to atticus and cousin ike rehash the war
261,tell you atticus cousin ike would say the missouri compromise was what licked us but if i had to go through it agin id walk every step of the way there an every step back jist like i did before an furthermore wed whip em this time
82,now in  when stonewall jackson came around by  i beg your pardon young folks
59, blue light was in heaven then god rest his saintly brow
30, come here scout said atticus
60,i crawled into his lap and tucked my head under his chin
49,he put his arms around me and rocked me gently
31,its different this time he said
78,this time we arent fighting the yankees were fighting our friends
117,but remember this no matter how bitter things get theyre still our friends and this is still our home
108, with this in mind i faced cecil jacobs in the schoolyard next day you gonna take that back boy
25, you gotta make me first
93,my folks said your daddy was a disgrace an that nigger oughta hang from the watertank
127, i drew a bead on him remembered what atticus had said then dropped my fists and walked away scouts a cow  ward
21, ringing in my ears
59,it was the first time i ever walked away from a fight
53,somehow if i fought cecil i would let atticus down
110,atticus so rarely asked jem and me to do something for him i could take being called a coward for him
91,i felt extremely noble for having remembered and remained noble for three weeks
43,then christmas came and disaster struck
50,jem and i viewed christmas with mixed feelings
49,the good side was the tree and uncle jack finch
109,every christmas eve day we met uncle jack at maycomb junction and he would spend a week with us
100,a flip of the coin revealed the uncompromising lineaments of aunt alexandra and francis
204,i suppose i should include uncle jimmy aunt alexandras husband but as he never spoke a word to me in my life except to say get off the fence once i never saw any reason to take notice of him
28,neither did aunt alexandra
186,long ago in a burst of friendliness aunty and uncle jimmy produced a son named henry who left home as soon as was humanly possible married and produced francis
126,henry and his wife deposited francis at his grandparents every christmas then pursued their own pleasures
88,no amount of sighing could induce atticus to let us spend christmas day at home
61,we went to finchs landing every christmas in my memory
135,the fact that aunty was a good cook was some compensation for being forced to spend a religious holiday with francis hancock
146,he was a year older than i and i avoided him on principle he enjoyed everything i disapproved of and disliked my ingenuous diversions
245,aunt alexandra was atticuss sister but when jem told me about changelings and siblings i decided that she had been swapped at birth that my grandparents had perhaps received a crawford instead of a finch
229,had i ever harbored the mystical notions about mountains that seem to obsess lawyers and judges aunt alexandra would have been analogous to mount everest throughout my early life she was cold and there
129,when uncle jack jumped down from the train christmas eve day we had to wait for the porter to hand him two long packages
143,jem and i always thought it funny when uncle jack pecked atticus on the cheek they were the only two men we ever saw kiss each other
194,uncle jack shook hands with jem and swung me high but not high enough uncle jack was a head shorter than atticus the baby of the family he was younger than aunt alexandra
133,he and aunty looked alike but uncle jack made better use of his face we were never wary of his sharp nose and chin
117,he was one of the few men of science who never terrified me probably because he never behaved like a doctor
276,whenever he performed a minor service for jem and me as removing a splinter from a foot he would tell us exactly what he was going to do give us an estimation of how much it would hurt and explain the use of any tongs he employed
121,one christmas i lurked in corners nursing a twisted splinter in my foot permitting no one to come near me
276,when uncle jack caught me he kept me laughing about a preacher who hated going to church so much that every day he stood at his gate in his dressinggown smoking a hookah and delivering fiveminute sermons to any passersby who desired spiritual comfort
225,i interrupted to make uncle jack let me know when he would pull it out but he held up a bloody splinter in a pair of tweezers and said he yanked it while i was laughing that was what was known as relativity
23,whats in those packages
77, i asked him pointing to the long thin parcels the porter had given him
31,none of your business he said
26,jem said hows rose aylmer
35, rose aylmer was uncle jacks cat
114,she was a beautiful yellow female uncle jack said was one of the few women he could stand permanently
70,he reached into his coat pocket and brought out some snapshots
15,we admired them
22,shes gettin fat i said
18,i should think so
68,she eats all the leftover fingers and ears from the hospital
30, aw thats a damn story i said
18,i beg your pardon
55, atticus said dont pay any attention to her jack
21,shes trying you out
53,cal says shes been cussing fluently for a week now
49, uncle jack raised his eyebrows and said nothing
185,i was proceeding on the dim theory aside from the innate attractiveness of such words that if atticus discovered i had picked them up at school he wouldnt make me go
102,but at supper that evening when i asked him to pass the damn ham please uncle jack pointed at me
38,see me afterwards young lady he said
73,when supper was over uncle jack went to the livingroom and sat down
52,he slapped his thighs for me to come sit on his lap
85,i liked to smell him he was like a bottle of alcohol and something pleasantly sweet
43,he pushed back my bangs and looked at me
51,youre more like atticus than your mother he said
47,youre also growing out of your pants a little
29, i reckon they fit all right
52, you like words like damn and hell now dont you
22, i said i reckoned so
89,well i dont said uncle jack not unless theres extreme provocation connected with em
87,ill be here a week and i dont want to hear any words like that while im here
75,scout youll get in trouble if you go around saying things like that
45,you want to grow up to be a lady dont you
25, i said not particularly
16,of course you do
25,now lets get to the tree
111, we decorated the tree until bedtime and that night i dreamed of the two long packages for jem and me
155,next morning jem and i dived for them they were from atticus who had written uncle jack to get them for us and they were what we had asked for
88,dont point them in the house said atticus when jem aimed at a picture on the wall
51,youll have to teach em to shoot said uncle jack
29,thats your job said atticus
35,i merely bowed to the inevitable
69, it took atticuss courtroom voice to drag us away from the tree
199,he declined to let us take our air rifles to the landing i had already begun to think of shooting francis and said if we made one false move hed take them away from us for good
116,finchs landing consisted of three hundred and sixtysix steps down a high bluff and ending in a jetty
219,farther down stream beyond the bluff were traces of an old cotton landing where finch negroes had loaded bales and produce unloaded blocks of ice flour and sugar farm equipment and feminine apparel
74,a tworut road ran from the riverside and vanished among dark trees
112,at the end of the road was a twostoried white house with porches circling it upstairs and downstairs
171,in his old age our ancestor simon finch had built it to please his nagging wife but with the porches all resemblance to ordinary houses of its era ended
158,the internal arrangements of the finch house were indicative of simons guilelessness and the absolute trust with which he regarded his offspring
142,there were six bedrooms upstairs four for the eight female children one for welcome finch the sole son and one for visiting relatives
139,simple enough but the daughters rooms could be reached only by one staircase welcomes room and the guestroom only by another
189,the daughters staircase was in the ground floor bedroom of their parents so simon always knew the hours of his daughters nocturnal comings and goings
429,there was a kitchen separate from the rest of the house tacked onto it by a wooden catwalk in the back yard was a rusty bell on a pole used to summon field hands or as a distress signal a widows walk was on the roof but no widows walked there  from it simon oversaw his overseer watched the riverboats and gazed into the lives of surrounding landholders
321,there went with the house the usual legend about the yankees one finch female recently engaged donned her complete trousseau to save it from raiders in the neighborhood she became stuck in the door to the daughters staircase but was doused with water and finally pushed through
228,when we arrived at the landing aunt alexandra kissed uncle jack francis kissed uncle jack uncle jimmy shook hands silently with uncle jack jem and i gave our presents to francis who gave us a present
91,jem felt his age and gravitated to the adults leaving me to entertain our cousin
45,francis was eight and slicked back his hair
29,whatd you get for christmas
16, i asked politely
28,just what i asked for he said
106,francis had requested a pair of kneepants a red leather booksack five shirts and an untied bow tie
15,thats nice i lied
81,jem and me got air rifles and jem got a chemistry set   a toy one i reckon
14, no a real one
76,hes gonna make me some invisible ink and im gonna write to dill in it
42, francis asked what was the use of that
88,well cant you just see his face when he gets a letter from me with nothing in it
18,itll drive him nuts
99, talking to francis gave me the sensation of settling slowly to the bottom of the ocean
43,he was the most boring child i ever met
262,as he lived in mobile he could not inform on me to school authorities but he managed to tell everything he knew to aunt alexandra who in turn unburdened herself to atticus who either forgot it or gave me hell whichever struck his fancy
141,but the only time i ever heard atticus speak sharply to anyone was when i once heard him say sister i do the best i can with them
59, it had something to do with my going around in overalls
56,aunt alexandra was fanatical on the subject of my attire
175,i could not possibly hope to be a lady if i wore breeches when i said i could do nothing in a dress she said i wasnt supposed to be doing things that required pants
235,aunt alexandras vision of my deportment involved playing with small stoves tea sets and wearing the addapearl necklace she gave me when i was born furthermore i should be a ray of sunshine in my fathers lonely life
210,i suggested that one could be a ray of sunshine in pants just as well but aunty said that one had to behave like a sunbeam that i was born good but had grown progressively worse every year
249,she hurt my feelings and set my teeth permanently on edge but when i asked atticus about it he said there were already enough sunbeams in the family and to go on about my business he didnt mind me much the way i was
127,at christmas dinner i sat at the little table in the diningroom jem and francis sat with the adults at the dining table
90,aunty had continued to isolate me long after jem and francis graduated to the big table
71,i often wondered what she thought id do get up and throw something
241,i sometimes thought of asking her if she would let me sit at the big table with the rest of them just once i would prove to her how civilized i could be after all i ate at home every day with no major mishaps
128,when i begged atticus to use his influence he said he had none  we were guests and we sat where she told us to sit
82,he also said aunt alexandra didnt understand girls much shed never had one
217,but her cooking made up for everything three kinds of meat summer vegetables from her pantry shelves peach pickles two kinds of cake and ambrosia constituted a modest christmas dinner
86,afterwards the adults made for the livingroom and sat around in a dazed condition
45,jem lay on the floor and i went to the back yard
66,put on your coat said atticus dreamily so i didnt hear him
44,francis sat beside me on the back steps
29,that was the best yet i said
40,grandmas a wonderful cook said francis
25,shes gonna teach me how
15, boys dont cook
44, i giggled at the thought of jem in an apron
150,grandma says all men should learn to cook that men oughta be careful with their wives and wait on em when they dont feel good said my cousin
35,i dont want dill waitin on me i said
21,id rather wait on him
100,dont say anything about it yet but were gonna get married as soon as were big enough
23,he asked me last summer
15, francis hooted
25,whats the matter with him
34,aint anything the matter with him
81, you mean that little runt grandma says stays with miss rachel every summer
26, thats exactly who i mean
35, i know all about him said francis
14,what about him
71, grandma says he hasnt got a home   has too he lives in meridian
98,   he just gets passed around from relative to relative and miss rachel keeps him every summer
20, francis thats not so
23, francis grinned at me
46,youre mighty dumb sometimes jean louise
38,guess you dont know any better though
18, what do you mean
126, if uncle atticus lets you run around with stray dogs thats his own business like grandma says so it aint your fault
192,i guess it aint your fault if uncle atticus is a niggerlover besides but im here to tell you it certainly does mortify the rest of the family   francis what the hell do you mean
18, just what i said
164,grandma says its bad enough he lets you all run wild but now hes turned out a niggerlover well never be able to walk the streets of maycomb agin
45,hes ruinin the family thats what hes doin
66, francis rose and sprinted down the catwalk to the old kitchen
62,at a safe distance he called hes nothin but a niggerlover
86,i dont know what youre talkin about but you better cut it out this red hot minute
49, i leaped off the steps and ran down the catwalk
30,it was easy to collar francis
27,i said take it back quick
52,francis jerked loose and sped into the old kitchen
11,niggerlover
56,when stalking ones prey it is best to take ones time
68,say nothing and as sure as eggs he will become curious and emerge
38,francis appeared at the kitchen door
29,you still mad jean louise
21, he asked tentatively
28,nothing to speak of i said
33,francis came out on the catwalk
37,you gonna take it back fra  ancis
35, but i was too quick on the draw
63,francis shot back into the kitchen so i retired to the steps
22,i could wait patiently
87,i had sat there perhaps five minutes when i heard aunt alexandra speak wheres francis
36, hes out yonder in the kitchen
47, he knows hes not supposed to play in there
96, francis came to the door and yelled grandma shes got me in here and she wont let me out
31, what is all this jean louise
33, i looked up at aunt alexandra
55,i havent got him in there aunty i aint holdin him
50, yes she is shouted francis she wont let me out
26, have you all been fussing
52, jean louise got mad at me grandma called francis
25,francis come out of there
73,jean louise if i hear another word out of you ill tell your father
35,did i hear you say hell a while ago
17, i thought i did
30,id better not hear it again
45, aunt alexandra was a backporch listener
77,the moment she was out of sight francis came out head up and grinning
28,dont you fool with me he said
129,he jumped into the yard and kept his distance kicking tufts of grass turning around occasionally to smile at me
55,jem appeared on the porch looked at us and went away
112,francis climbed the mimosa tree came down put his hands in his pockets and strolled around the yard
49,i asked him who he thought he was uncle jack
83,francis said he reckoned i got told for me to just sit there and leave him alone
28,i aint botherin you i said
195,francis looked at me carefully concluded that i had been sufficiently subdued and crooned softly niggerlover this time i split my knuckle to the bone on his front teeth
63,my left impaired i sailed in with my right but not for long
59,uncle jack pinned my arms to my sides and said standstill
136, aunt alexandra ministered to francis wiping his tears away with her handkerchief rubbing his hair patting his cheek
101,atticus jem and uncle jimmy had come to the back porch when francis started yelling
15,who started this
17, said uncle jack
37,francis and i pointed at each other
69,grandma he bawled she called me a whorelady and jumped on me
20, is that true scout
15, said uncle jack
12,i reckon so
81, when uncle jack looked down at me his features were like aunt alexandras
74,you know i told you youd get in trouble if you used words like that
17,i told you didnt i
40, yes sir but well youre in trouble now
155, i was debating whether to stand there or run and tarried in indecision a moment too long i turned to flee but uncle jack was quicker
94,i found myself suddenly looking at a tiny ant struggling with a bread crumb in the grass
49,ill never speak to you again as long as i live
58,i hate you an despise you an hope you die tomorrow
74, a statement that seemed to encourage uncle jack more than anything
92,i ran to atticus for comfort but he said i had it coming and it was high time we went home
130,i climbed into the back seat of the car without saying goodbye to anyone and at home i ran to my room and slammed the door
58,jem tried to say something nice but i wouldnt let him
155,when i surveyed the damage there were only seven or eight red marks and i was reflecting upon relativity when someone knocked on the door
39,i asked who it was uncle jack answered
78, uncle jack said if i talked like that hed lick me again so i was quiet
80,when he entered the room i retreated to a corner and turned my back on him
36,scout he said do you still hate me
16, go on please sir
56, why i didnt think youd hold it against me he said
64,im disappointed in you  you had that coming and you know it
12, didnt either
85, honey you cant go around calling people   you aint fair i said you aint fair
31, uncle jacks eyebrows went up
125, youre real nice uncle jack an i reckon i love you even after what you did but you dont understand children much
60, uncle jack put his hands on his hips and looked down at me
58,and why do i not understand children miss jean louise
52,such conduct as yours required little understanding
96,it was obstreperous disorderly and abusive   you gonna give me a chance to tell you
53,i dont mean to sass you im just tryin to tell you
32, uncle jack sat down on the bed
79,his eyebrows came together and he peered up at me from under them
14,proceed he said
19,i took a deep breath
125,well in the first place you never stopped to gimme a chance to tell you my side of it  you just lit right into me
319,when jem an i fuss atticus doesnt ever just listen to jems side of it he hears mine too an in the second place you told me never to use words like that except in exextreme provocation and francis provocated me enough to knock his block off   uncle jack scratched his head
30,what was your side of it scout
74, francis called atticus somethin an i wasnt about to take it off him
25, what did francis call him
15, a niggerlover
199,i aint very sure what it means but the way francis said it  tell you one thing right now uncle jack ill be  i swear before god if ill sit there and let him say somethin about atticus
24, he called atticus that
30, yes sir he did an a lot more
75,said atticusd be the ruination of the family an he let jem an me run wild
71, from the look on uncle jacks face i thought i was in for it again
68,when he said well see about this i knew francis was in for it
38,ive a good mind to go out there tonight
26, please sir just let it go
45, ive no intention of letting it go he said
34,alexandra should know about this
48,the idea of  waitll i get my hands on that boy
52, uncle jack please promise me somethin please sir
46,promise you wont tell atticus about this
155,he  he asked me one time not to let anything i heard about him make me mad an id ruther him think we were fightin about somethin else instead
14,please promise
79, but i dont like francis getting away with something like that   he didnt
35,you reckon you could tie up my hand
21,its still bleedin some
23, of course i will baby
58,i know of no hand i would be more delighted to tie up
22,will you come this way
50, uncle jack gallantly bowed me to the bathroom
249,while he cleaned and bandaged my knuckles he entertained me with a tale about a funny nearsighted old gentleman who had a cat named hodge and who counted all the cracks in the sidewalk when he went to town
19,there now he said
67,youll have a very unladylike scar on your weddingring finger
15, thank you sir
18, whats a whorelady
243, uncle jack plunged into another long tale about an old prime minister who sat in the house of commons and blew feathers in the air and tried to keep them there when all about him men were losing their heads
79,i guess he was trying to answer my question but he made no sense whatsoever
187,later when i was supposed to be in bed i went down the hall for a drink of water and heard atticus and uncle jack in the livingroom i shall never marry atticus
23, i might have children
40, atticus said youve a lot to learn jack
56,your daughter gave me my first lessons this afternoon
62,she said i didnt understand children much and told me why
21,she was quite right
88,atticus she told me how i should have treated her  oh dear im so sorry i romped on her
19, atticus chuckled
42,she earned it so dont feel too remorseful
75, i waited on tenterhooks for uncle jack to tell atticus my side of it
13,but he didnt
90,he simply murmured her use of bathroom invective leaves nothing to the imagination
87,but she doesnt know the meaning of half she says  she asked me what a whorelady was
17, did you tell her
37, no i told her about lord melbourne
64,when a child asks you something answer him for goodness sake
34,but dont make a production of it
123,children are children but they can spot an evasion quicker than adults and evasion simply muddles em
91,no my father mused you had the right answer this afternoon but the wrong reasons
132,bad language is a stage all children go through and it dies with time when they learn theyre not attracting attention with it
16,hotheadedness isnt
113,scouts got to learn to keep her head and learn soon with whats in store for her these next few months
25,shes coming along though
67,jems getting older and she follows his example a good bit now
39,all she needs is assistance sometimes
45, atticus youve never laid a hand on her
14, i admit that
47,so far ive been able to get by with threats
37,jack she minds me as well as she can
55,doesnt come up to scratch half the time but she tries
41, thats not the answer said uncle jack
45,no the answer is she knows i know she tries
32,thats what makes the difference
96,what bothers me is that she and jem will have to absorb some ugly things pretty soon
135,im not worried about jem keeping his head but scout d just as soon jump on someone as look at him if her prides at stake
48, i waited for uncle jack to break his promise
15,he still didnt
35,atticus how bad is this going to be
46,you havent had too much chance to discuss it
25, it couldnt be worse jack
69,the only thing weve got is a black mans word against the ewells
45,the evidence boils down to youdid  ididnt
145,the jury couldnt possibly be expected to take tom robinsons word against the ewells  are you acquainted with the ewells
42, uncle jack said yes he remembered them
73,he described them to atticus but atticus said youre a generation off
38,the present ones are the same though
30, what are you going to do then
120, before im through i intend to jar the jury a bit  i think well have a reasonable chance on appeal though
39,i really cant tell at this stage jack
130,you know id hoped to get through life without a case of this kind but john taylor pointed at me and said youre it
33, let this cup pass from you eh
52,but do you think i could face my children otherwise
203,you know whats going to happen as well as i do jack and i hope and pray i can get jem and scout through it without bitterness and most of all without catching maycombs usual disease
137,why reasonable people go stark raving mad when anything involving a negro comes up is something i dont pretend to understand
99,i just hope that jem and scout come to me for their answers instead of listening to the town
30,i hope they trust me enough
10,jean louise
16, my scalp jumped
35,i stuck my head around the corner
40, i scurried to my room and went to bed
57,uncle jack was a prince of a fellow not to let me down
173,but i never figured out how atticus knew i was listening and it was not until many years later that i realized he wanted me to hear every word he said
72,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  atticus was feeble he was nearly fifty
143,when jem and i asked him why he was so old he said he got started late which we felt reflected upon his abilities and manliness
188,he was much older than the parents of our school contemporaries and there was nothing jem or i could say about him when our classmates said my father jem was football crazy
129,atticus was never too tired to play keepaway but when jem wanted to tackle him atticus would say im too old for that son
28, our father didnt do anything
42,he worked in an office not in a drugstore
198,atticus did not drive a dumptruck for the county he was not the sheriff he did not farm work in a garage or do anything that could possibly arouse the admiration of anyone
28,besides that he wore glasses
100,he was nearly blind in his left eye and said left eyes were the tribal curse of the finches
101,whenever he wanted to see something well he turned his head and looked from his right eye
139,he did not do the things our schoolmates fathers did he never went hunting he did not play poker or fish or drink or smoke
33,he sat in the livingroom and read
216,with these attributes however he would not remain as inconspicuous as we wished him to that year the school buzzed with talk about him defending tom robinson none of which was complimentary
181,after my bout with cecil jacobs when i committed myself to a policy of cowardice word got around that scout finch wouldnt fight any more her daddy wouldnt let her
105,this was not entirely correct i wouldnt fight publicly for atticus but the family was private ground
67,i would fight anyone from a third cousin upwards tooth and nail
40,francis hancock for example knew that
70,when he gave us our airrifles atticus wouldnt teach us to shoot
90,uncle jack instructed us in the rudiments thereof he said atticus wasnt interested in guns
113,atticus said to jem one day id rather you shot at tin cans in the back yard but i know youll go after birds
100,shoot all the bluejays you want if you can hit em but remember its a sin to kill a mockingbird
122, that was the only time i ever heard atticus say it was a sin to do something and i asked miss maudie about it
25,your fathers right she said
65,mockingbirds dont do one thing but make music for us to enjoy
123,they dont eat up peoples gardens dont nest in corncribs they dont do one thing but sing their hearts out for us
40,thats why its a sin to kill a mockingbird
50, miss maudie this is an old neighborhood aint it
31, been here longer than the town
54, nome i mean the folks on our street are all old
45,jem and mes the only children around here
91,mrs dubose is close on to a hundred and miss rachels old and so are you and atticus
54, i dont call fifty very old said miss maudie tartly
34,not being wheeled around yet am i
20,neither s your father
201,but i must say providence was kind enough to burn down that old mausoleum of mine im too old to keep it up  maybe youre right jean louise this is a settled neighborhood
51,youve never been around young folks much have you
16, yessum at school
23, i mean young grownups
20,youre lucky you know
49,you and jem have the benefit of your fathers age
59,if your father was thirty youd find life quite different
11, i sure would
24,atticus cant do anything
35, youd be surprised said miss maudie
22,theres life in him yet
14, what can he do
76, well he can make somebodys will so airtight cant anybody meddle with it
71, shoot well did you know hes the best checkerplayer in this town
119,why down at the landing when we were coming up atticus finch could beat everybody on both sides of the river
58, good lord miss maudie jem and me beat him all the time
58, its about time you found out its because he lets you
39,did you know he can play a jews harp
80, this modest accomplishment served to make me even more ashamed of him
14,well she said
22,well what miss maudie
11, well nothing
53,nothing  it seems with all that youd be proud of him
30,cant everybody play a jews harp
44,now keep out of the way of the carpenters
68,youd better go home ill be in my azaleas and cant watch you
20,plank might hit you
124, i went to the back yard and found jem plugging away at a tin can which seemed stupid with all the bluejays around
289,i returned to the front yard and busied myself for two hours erecting a complicated breastworks at the side of the porch consisting of a tire an orange crate the laundry hamper the porch chairs and a small us flag jem gave me from a popcorn box
95,when atticus came home to dinner he found me crouched down aiming across the street
25,what are you shooting at
23, miss maudie s rear end
71, atticus turned and saw my generous target bending over her bushes
72,he pushed his hat to the back of his head and crossed the street
49,maudie he called i thought id better warn you
30,youre in considerable peril
51, miss maudie straightened up and looked toward me
44,she said atticus you are a devil from hell
49, when atticus returned he told me to break camp
75,dont you ever let me catch you pointing that gun at anybody again he said
40,i wished my father was a devil from hell
42,i sounded out calpurnia on the subject
31,why he can do lots of things
29,calpurnia scratched her head
35,well i dont rightly know she said
188,jem underlined it when he asked atticus if he was going out for the methodists and atticus said hed break his neck if he did he was just too old for that sort of thing
133,the methodists were trying to pay off their church mortgage and had challenged the baptists to a game of touch football
67,everybody in towns father was playing it seemed except atticus
235,jem said he didnt even want to go but he was unable to resist football in any form and he stood gloomily on the sidelines with atticus and me watching cecil jacobss father make touchdowns for the baptists
120,one saturday jem and i decided to go exploring with our airrifles to see if we could find a rabbit or a squirrel
120,we had gone about five hundred yards beyond the radley place when i noticed jem squinting at something down the street
91,he had turned his head to one side and was looking out of the corners of his eyes
19,whatcha looking at
33, that old dog down yonder he said
30,thats old tim johnson aint it
128, tim johnson was the property of mr harry johnson who drove the mobile bus and lived on the southern edge of town
54,tim was a livercolored bird dog the pet of maycomb
14,whats he doing
18, i dont know scout
16,we better go home
21, aw jem its february
31, i dont care im gonna tell cal
41, we raced home and ran to the kitchen
57,cal said jem can you come down the sidewalk a minute
14, what for jem
56,i cant come down the sidewalk every time you want me
56, theres somethin wrong with an old dog down yonder
18, calpurnia sighed
36,i cant wrap up any dogs foot now
65,theres some gauze in the bathroom go get it and do it yourself
20, jem shook his head
11,hes sick cal
25,somethings wrong with him
45, whats he do in trying to catch his tail
24, no hes doin like this
79, jem gulped like a goldfish hunched his shoulders and twitched his torso
47,hes goin like that only not like he means to
34, are you telling me a story jem finch
26, calpurnias voice hardened
22,no cal i swear im not
14, was he runnin
63, no hes just moseyin along so slow you cant hardly tell it
20,hes comin this way
62, calpurnia rinsed her hands and followed jem into the yard
28,i dont see any dog she said
69,she followed us beyond the radley place and looked where jem pointed
89,tim johnson was not much more than a speck in the distance but he was closer to us
79,he walked erratically as if his right legs were shorter than his left legs
47,he reminded me of a car stuck in a sandbed
27,hes gone lopsided said jem
69,calpurnia stared then grabbed us by the shoulders and ran us home
105,she shut the wood door behind us went to the telephone and shouted gimme mr finchs office
12, she shouted
11,this is cal
152,i swear to god theres a mad dog down the street a piece  hes comin this way yes sir hes  mr finch i declare he is  old tim johnson yes sir
93,yes   she hung up and shook her head when we tried to ask her what atticus had said
304,she rattled the telephone hook and said miss eula may  now maam im through talkin to mr finch please dont connect me no more  listen miss eula may can you call miss rachel and miss stephanie crawford and whoever s got a phone on this street and tell em a mad dogs comin
12,please maam
22, calpurnia listened
74,i know its february miss eula may but i know a mad dog when i see one
16,please maam hurry
42, calpurnia asked jem radleys got a phone
35, jem looked in the book and said no
32,they wont come out anyway cal
30, i dont care im gonna tell em
52, she ran to the front porch jem and i at her heels
21,you stay in that house
9, she yelled
59,calpurnias message had been received by the neighborhood
65,every wood door within our range of vision was closed tight
30,we saw no trace of tim johnson
106,we watched calpurnia running toward the radley place holding her skirt and apron above her knees
60,she went up to the front steps and banged on the door
78,she got no answer and she shouted mr nathan mr arthur mad dogs comin
15,mad dogs comin
45, shes supposed to go around in back i said
16,jem shook his head
38,dont make any difference now he said
42,calpurnia pounded on the door in vain
73,no one acknowledged her warning no one seemed to have heard it
81,as calpurnia sprinted to the back porch a black ford swung into the driveway
35,atticus and mr heck tate got out
55,mr heck tate was the sheriff of maycomb county
37,he was as tall as atticus but thinner
96,he was longnosed wore boots with shiny metal eyeholes boot pants and a lumber jacket
48,his belt had a row of bullets sticking in it
24,he carried a heavy rifle
63,when he and atticus reached the porch jem opened the door
27,stay inside son said atticus
15,where is he cal
69, he oughta be here by now said calpurnia pointing down the street
16,not runnin is he
14, asked mr tate
38,naw sir hes in the twitchin stage mr
31, should we go after him heck
14, asked atticus
25,we better wait mr finch
61,they usually go in a straight line but you never can tell
87,he might follow the curve  hope he does or hell go straight in the radley back yard
19,lets wait a minute
58, dont think hell get in the radley yard said atticus
16,fence  stop him
29,hell probably follow the road
128, i thought mad dogs foamed at the mouth galloped leaped and lunged at throats and i thought they did it in august
66,had tim johnson behaved thus i would have been less frightened
59,nothing is more deadly than a deserted waiting street
108,the trees were still the mockingbirds were silent the carpenters at miss maudies house had vanished
40,i heard mr tate sniff then blow his nose
50,i saw him shift his gun to the crook of his arm
87,i saw miss stephanie crawfords face framed in the glass window of her front door
45,miss maudie appeared and stood beside her
106,atticus put his foot on the rung of a chair and rubbed his hand slowly down the side of his thigh
23,there he is he said softly
114,tim johnson came into sight walking dazedly in the inner rim of the curve parallel to the radley house
26,look at him whispered jem
44,mr heck said they walked in a straight line
30,he cant even stay in the road
44, he looks more sick than anything i said
64,let anything get in front of him and hell come straight at it
57, mr tate put his hand to his forehead and leaned forward
23,hes got it all right mr
205, tim johnson was advancing at a snails pace but he was not playing or sniffing at foliage he seemed dedicated to one course and motivated by an invisible force that was inching him toward us
142,we could see him shiver like a horse shedding flies his jaw opened and shut he was alist but he was being pulled gradually toward us
39,hes lookin for a place to die said jem
22,mr tate turned around
48,hes far from dead jem he hasnt got started yet
188, tim johnson reached the side street that ran in front of the radley place and what remained of his poor mind made him pause and seem to consider which road he would take
133,he made a few hesitant steps and stopped in front of the radley gate then he tried to turn around but was having difficulty
38,atticus said hes within range heck
101,you better get him before he goes down the side street  lord knows whos around the corner
13,go inside cal
107, calpurnia opened the screen door latched it behind her then unlatched it and held onto the hook
91,she tried to block jem and me with her body but we looked out from beneath her arms
11,take him mr
66, mr tate handed the rifle to atticus jem and i nearly fainted
35,dont waste time heck said atticus
33, mr finch this is a oneshot job
66, atticus shook his head vehemently dont just stand there heck
81,he wont wait all day for you   for gods sake mr finch look where he is
48,miss and youll go straight into the radley house
37,i cant shoot that well and you know it
84, i havent shot a gun in thirty years   mr tate almost threw the rifle at atticus
51,id feel mighty comfortable if you did now he said
102,in a fog jem and i watched our father take the gun and walk out into the middle of the street
117,he walked quickly but i thought he moved like an underwater swimmer time had slowed to a nauseating crawl
116,when atticus raised his glasses calpurnia murmured sweet jesus help him and put her hands to her cheeks
109,atticus pushed his glasses to his forehead they slipped down and he dropped them in the street
35,in the silence i heard them crack
63,atticus rubbed his eyes and chin we saw him blink hard
86,in front of the radley gate tim johnson had made up what was left of his mind
85,he had finally turned himself around to pursue his original course up our street
58,he made two steps forward then stopped and raised his head
24,we saw his body go rigid
139,with movements so swift they seemed simultaneous atticus s hand yanked a ball tipped lever as he brought the gun to his shoulder
17,the rifle cracked
92,tim johnson leaped flopped over and crumpled on the sidewalk in a brownandwhite heap
26,he didnt know what hit him
58,mr tate jumped off the porch and ran to the radley place
123,he stopped in front of the dog squatted turned around and tapped his finger on his forehead above his left eye
51,you were a little to the right mr finch he called
29,always was answered atticus
43,if i had my druthers id take a shotgun
169, he stooped and picked up his glasses ground the broken lenses to powder under his heel and went to mr tate and stood looking down at tim johnson
65,doors opened one by one and the neighborhood slowly came alive
68,miss maudie walked down the steps with miss stephanie crawford
17,jem was paralyzed
101,i pinched him to get him moving but when atticus saw us coming he called stay where you are
70, when mr tate and atticus returned to the yard mr tate was smiling
35,ill have zeebo collect him he said
30,you havent forgot much mr finch
27,they say it never leaves you
19, atticus was silent
26, i saw that oneshot finch
48, atticus wheeled around and faced miss maudie
95,they looked at one another without saying anything and atticus got into the sheriffs car
24,come here he said to jem
42,dont you go near that dog you understand
57,dont go near him hes just as dangerous dead as alive
19, yes sir said jem
17,atticus what son
51, whats the matter with you boy cant you talk
31, said mr tate grinning at jem
77,didnt you know your daddys   hush heck said atticus lets go back to town
69, when they drove away jem and i went to miss stephanies front steps
57,we sat waiting for zeebo to arrive in the garbage truck
116,jem sat in numb confusion and miss stephanie said uh uh uh whoda thought of a mad dog in february
44,maybe he wadnt mad maybe he was just crazy
116,id hate to see harry johnsons face when he gets in from the mobile run and finds atticus finchs shot his dog
241,bet he was just full of fleas from somewhere   miss maudie said miss stephanied be singing a different tune if tim johnson was still coming up the street that theyd find out soon enough theyd send his head to montgomery
53,jem became vaguely articulate d you see him scout
35,d you see him just standin there
94,n all of a sudden he just relaxed all over an it looked like that gun was a part of him
27,an he did it so quick like
88,i hafta aim for ten minutes fore i can hit somethin  miss maudie grinned wickedly
92,well now miss jean louise she said still think your father cant do anything
22,still ashamed of him
20, nome i said meekly
136,forgot to tell you the other day that besides playing the jews harp atticus finch was the deadest shot in maycomb county in his time
11, echoed jem
26,thats what i said jem finch
34,guess youll change your tune now
76,the very idea didnt you know his nickname was  oneshot when he was a boy
147,why down at the landing when he was coming up if he shot fifteen times and hit fourteen doves hed complain about wasting ammunition
51, he never said anything about that jem muttered
37,never said anything about it did he
47, wonder why he never goes huntin now i said
37,maybe i can tell you said miss maudie
53,if your fathers anything hes civilized in his heart
149,marksmanships a gift of god a talent  oh you have to practice to make it perfect but shootins different from playing the piano or the like
134,i think maybe he put his gun down when he realized that god had given him an unfair advantage over most living things
74,i guess he decided he wouldnt shoot till he had to and he had to today
40, looks like hed be proud of it i said
89,people in their right minds never take pride in their talents said miss maudie
22,we saw zeebo drive up
95,he took a pitchfork from the back of the garbage truck and gingerly lifted tim johnson
118,he pitched the dog onto the truck then poured something from a gallon jug on and around the spot where tim fell
49,dont yawl come over here for a while he called
96,when we went home i told jem wed really have something to talk about at school on monday
16,jem turned on me
40,dont say anything about it scout he said
14,i certainly am
59,aint everybodys daddy the deadest shot in maycomb county
66, jem said i reckon if hed wanted us to know it heda told us
35,if he was proud of it hedatoldus
42, maybe it just slipped his mind i said
49,naw scout its something you wouldnt understand
123,atticus is real old but i wouldnt care if he couldnt do anything  i wouldnt care if he couldnt do a blessed thing
69, jem picked up a rock and threw it jubilantly at the carhouse
71,running after it he called back atticus is a gentleman just like me
384, contents  p rev  n ext chapter  when we were small jem and i confined our activities to the southern neighborhood but when i was well into the second grade at school and tormenting boo radley became passe the business section of maycomb drew us frequently up the street past the real property of mrs henry lafayette dubose
111,it was impossible to go to town without passing her house unless we wished to walk a mile out of the way
115,previous minor encounters with her left me with no desire for more but jem said i had to grow up some time
168,mrs dubose lived alone except for a negro girl in constant attendance two doors up the street from us in a house with steep front steps and a dogtrot hall
92,she was very old she spent most of each day in bed and the rest of it in a wheelchair
100,it was rumored that she kept a csa pistol concealed among her numerous shawls and wraps
22,jem and i hated her
272,if she was on the porch when we passed we would be raked by her wrathful gaze subjected to ruthless interrogation regarding our behavior and given a melancholy prediction on what we would amount to when we grew up which was always nothing
185,we had long ago given up the idea of walking past her house on the opposite side of the street that only made her raise her voice and let the whole neighborhood in on it
35,we could do nothing to please her
122,if i said as sunnily as i could hey mrs dubose i would receive for an answer dont you say hey to me you ugly girl
28,you say good afternoon mrs
16, she was vicious
88,once she heard jem refer to our father as atticus and her reaction was apoplectic
188,besides being the sassiest most disrespectful mutts who ever passed her way we were told that it was quite a pity our father had not remarried after our mothers death
138,a lovelier lady than our mother never lived she said and it was heartbreaking the way atticus finch let her children run wild
157,i did not remember our mother but jem did  he would tell me about her sometimes  and he went livid when mrs dubose shot us this message
285,jem having survived boo radley a mad dog and other terrors had concluded that it was cowardly to stop at miss rachels front steps and wait and had decreed that we must run as far as the post office corner each evening to meet atticus coming from work
104,countless evenings atticus would find jem furious at something mrs dubose had said when we went by
38,easy does it son atticus would say
85,shes an old lady and shes ill you just hold your head high and be a gentleman
73,whatever she says to you its your job not to let her make you mad
63, jem would say she must not be very sick she hollered so
134,when the three of us came to her house atticus would sweep off his hat wave gallantly to her and say good evening mrs dubose
41,you look like a picture this evening
53, i never heard atticus say like a picture of what
118,he would tell her the courthouse news and would say he hoped with all his heart shed have a good day tomorrow
132,he would return his hat to his head swing me to his shoulders in her very presence and we would go home in the twilight
146,it was times like these when i thought my father who hated guns and had never been to any wars was the bravest man who ever lived
129,the day after jems twelfth birthday his money was burning up his pockets so we headed for town in the early afternoon
111,jem thought he had enough to buy a miniature steam engine for himself and a twirling baton for me
137,i had long had my eye on that baton it was at v j elmores it was bedecked with sequins and tinsel it cost seventeen cents
105,it was then my burning ambition to grow up and twirl with the maycomb county high school band
213,having developed my talent to where i could throw up a stick and almost catch it coming down i had caused calpurnia to deny me entrance to the house every time she saw me with a stick in my hand
120,i felt that i could overcome this defect with a real baton and i thought it generous of jem to buy one for me
58,mrs dubose was stationed on her porch when we went by
47,where are you two going at this time of day
12, she shouted
25,playing hooky i suppose
44,ill just call up the principal and tell him
80, she put her hands on the wheels of her chair and executed a perfect right face
40,aw its saturday mrs dubose said jem
58,makes no difference if its saturday she said obscurely
47,i wonder if your father knows where you are
78, mrs dubose weve been goin to town by ourselves since we were this high
71, jem placed his hand palm down about two feet above the sidewalk
17,dont you lie to me
12, she yelled
88,jeremy finch maudie atkinson told me you broke down her scuppernong arbor this morning
89,shes going to tell your father and then youll wish you never saw the light of day
81,if you arent sent to the reform school before next week my names not dubose
171, jem who hadnt been near miss maudies scuppernong arbor since last summer and who knew miss maudie wouldnt tell atticus if he had issued a general denial
24,dont you contradict me
19, mrs dubose bawled
88,and you   she pointed an arthritic finger at me  what are you doing in those overalls
55,you should be in a dress and camisole young lady
115,youll grow up waiting on tables if somebody doesnt change your ways  a finch waiting on tables at the ok
15, i was terrified
58,cafe was a dim organization on the north side of the square
43,i grabbed jems hand but he shook me loose
26,come on scout he whispered
77,dont pay any attention to her just hold your head high and be a gentleman
106, but mrs dubose held us not only a finch waiting on tables but one in the courthouse lawing for niggers
14, jem stiffened
143,mrs duboses shot had gone home and she knew it yes indeed what has this world come to when a finch goes against his raising
12,ill tell you
29, she put her hand to her mouth
67,when she drew it away it trailed a long silver thread of saliva
63,your fathers no better than the niggers and trash he works for
16, jem was scarlet
297,i pulled at his sleeve and we were followed up the sidewalk by a philippic on our familys moral degeneration the major premise of which was that half the finches were in the asylum anyway but if our mother were living we would not have come to such a state
114,i wasnt sure what jem resented most but i took umbrage at mrs duboses assessment of the familys mental hygiene
77,i had become almost accustomed to hearing insults aimed at atticus
47,but this was the first one coming from an adult
81,except for her remarks about atticus mrs duboses attack was only routine
148,there was a hint of summer in the air  in the shadows it was cool but the sun was warm which meant good times coming no school and dill
68,jem bought his steam engine and we went by elmores for my baton
117,jem took no pleasure in his acquisition he jammed it in his pocket and walked silently beside me toward home
78,on the way home i nearly hit mr link deas who said look out now scout
156, when i missed a toss and when we approached mrs duboses house my baton was grimy from having picked it up out of the dirt so many times
25,she was not on the porch
211,in later years i sometimes wondered exactly what made jem do it what made him break the bonds of you just be a gentleman son and the phase of self conscious rectitude he had recently entered
215,jem had probably stood as much guff about atticus lawing for niggers as had i and i took it for granted that he kept his temper  he had a naturally tranquil disposition and a slow fuse
127,at the time however i thought the only explanation for what he did was that for a few minutes he simply went mad
172,what jem did was something id do as a matter of course had i not been under atticus s interdict which i assumed included not fighting horrible old ladies
326,we had just come to her gate when jem snatched my baton and ran flailing wildly up the steps into mrs duboses front yard forgetting everything atticus had said forgetting that she packed a pistol under her shawls forgetting that if mrs dubose missed her girl jessie probably wouldnt
166,he did not begin to calm down until he had cut the tops off every camellia bush mrs dubose owned until the ground was littered with green buds and leaves
80,he bent my baton against his knee snapped it in two and threw it down
31,by that time i was shrieking
146,jem yanked my hair said he didnt care hed do it again if he got a chance and if i didnt shut up hed pull every hair out of my head
33,i didnt shut up and he kicked me
39,i lost my balance and fell on my face
62,jem picked me up roughly but looked like he was sorry
25,there was nothing to say
59,we did not choose to meet atticus coming home that evening
58,we skulked around the kitchen until calpurnia threw us out
67,by some voodoo system calpurnia seemed to know all about it
156,she was a less than satisfactory source of palliation but she did give jem a hot biscuitandbutter which he tore in half and shared with me
22,it tasted like cotton
28,we went to the livingroom
117,i picked up a football magazine found a picture of dixie howell showed it to jem and said this looks like you
80, that was the nicest thing i could think to say to him but it was no help
78,he sat by the windows hunched down in a rocking chair scowling waiting
14,daylight faded
99,two geological ages later we heard the soles of atticus s shoes scrape the front steps
123,the screen door slammed there was a pause  atticus was at the hat rack in the hall  and we heard him call jem
39, his voice was like the winter wind
100,atticus switched on the ceiling light in the livingroom and found us there frozen still
80,he carried my baton in one hand its filthy yellow tassel trailed on the rug
63,he held out his other hand it contained fat camellia buds
43,jem he said are you responsible for this
11, whydyoudoit
61, jem said softly she said you lawed for niggers and trash
35, you did this because she said that
51, jems lips moved but his yes sir was inaudible
191,son i have no doubt that youve been annoyed by your contemporaries about me lawing for niggers as you say but to do something like this to a sick old lady is inexcusable
83,i strongly advise you to go down and have a talk with mrs dubose said atticus
30,come straight home afterward
17, jem did not move
13,go on i said
39, i followed jem out of the livingroom
37,come back here atticus said to me
11,i came back
86,atticus picked up the mobile press and sat down in the rocking chair jem had vacated
214,for the life of me i did not understand how he could sit there in cold blood and read a newspaper when his only son stood an excellent chance of being murdered with a confederate army relic
111,of course jem antagonized me sometimes until i could kill him but when it came down to it he was all i had
71,atticus did not seem to realize this or if he did he didnt care
142,i hated him for that but when you are in trouble you become easily tired soon i was hiding in his lap and his arms were around me
40,youre mighty big to be rocked he said
43,you dont care what happens to him i said
84,you just send him on to get shot at when all he was doin was standin up for you
41, atticus pushed my head under his chin
36,its not time to worry yet he said
103,i never thought jemd be the one to lose his head over this  thought id have more trouble with you
127, i said i didnt see why we had to keep our heads anyway that nobody i knew at school had to keep his head about anything
97,scout said atticus when summer comes youll have to keep your head about far worse things
351,its not fair for you and jem i know that but sometimes we have to make the best of things and the way we conduct ourselves when the chips are down  well all i can say is when you and jem are grown maybe youll look back on this with some compassion and some feeling that i didnt let you down
178,this case tom robinsons case is something that goes to the essence of a mans conscience  scout i couldnt go to church and worship god if i didnt try to help that man
31, atticus you must be wrong
67, well most folks seem to think theyre right and youre wrong
200, theyre certainly entitled to think that and theyre entitled to full respect for their opinions said atticus but before i can live with other folks ive got to live with myself
78,the one thing that doesnt abide by majority rule is a persons conscience
65, when jem returned he found me still in atticuss lap well son
13, said atticus
71,he set me on my feet and i made a secret reconnaissance of jem
72,he seemed to be all in one piece but he had a queer look on his face
44,perhaps she had given him a dose of calomel
145,i cleaned it up for her and said i was sorry but i aint and that id work on em ever saturday and try to make em grow back out
75, there was no point in saying you were sorry if you arent said atticus
82,jem shes old and ill you cant hold her responsible for what she says and does
113,of course id rather shed have said it to me than to either of you but we cant always have our druthers
49, jem seemed fascinated by a rose in the carpet
49,atticus he said she wants me to read to her
11, read to her
118,she wants me to come every afternoon after school and saturdays and read to her out loud for two hours
19,atticus do i have to
40, but she wants me to do it for a month
29, then youll do it for a month
86, jem planted his big toe delicately in the center of the rose and pressed it in
106,finally he said atticus its all right on the sidewalk but inside its  its all dark and creepy
40,theres shadows and things on the ceiling
24, atticus smiled grimly
41,that should appeal to your imagination
44,just pretend youre inside the radley house
137, the following monday afternoon jem and i climbed the steep front steps to mrs duboses house and padded down the open hallway
97,jem armed with ivanhoe and full of superior knowledge knocked at the second door on the left
59,jessie opened the wood door and unlatched the screen door
22,is that you jem finch
29,you got your sister with you
53,i dont know   let em both in jessie said mrs dubose
47,jessie admitted us and went off to the kitchen
211,an oppressive odor met us when we crossed the threshold an odor i had met many times in rainrotted gray houses where there are coaloil lamps water dippers and unbleached domestic sheets
40,it always made me afraid expectant watchful
81,in the corner of the room was a brass bed and in the bed was mrs dubose
88,i wondered if jems activities had put her there and for a moment i felt sorry for her
70,she was lying under a pile of quilts and looked almost friendly
217,there was a marbletopped washstand by her bed on it were a glass with a teaspoon in it a red ear syringe a box of absorbent cotton and a steel alarm clock standing on three tiny legs
59,so you brought that dirty little sister of yours did you
18, was her greeting
112,jem said quietly my sister aint dirty and i aint scared of you although i noticed his knees shaking
86,i was expecting a tirade but all she said was you may commence reading jeremy
58, jem sat down in a canebottom chair and opened ivanhoe
42,i pulled up another one and sat beside him
28,come closer said mrs dubose
29,come to the side of the bed
28, we moved our chairs forward
117,this was the nearest i had ever been to her and the thing i wanted most to do was move my chair back again
17,she was horrible
185,her face was the color of a dirty pillowcase and the corners of her mouth glistened with wet which inched like a glacier down the deep grooves enclosing her chin
86,oldage liver spots dotted her cheeks and her pale eyes had black pinpoint pupils
74,her hands were knobby and the cuticles were grown up over her fingernails
162,her bottom plate was not in and her upper lip protruded from time to time she would draw her nether lip to her upper plate and carry her chin with it
31,this made the wet move faster
39,i didnt look any more than i had to
41,jem reopened ivanhoe and began reading
52,i tried to keep up with him but he read too fast
122,when jem came to a word he didnt know he skipped it but mrs dubose would catch him and make him spell it out
165,jem read for perhaps twenty minutes during which time i looked at the sootstained mantelpiece out the window anywhere to keep from looking at her
157,as he read along i noticed that mrs dubose s corrections grew fewer and farther between that jem had even left one sentence dangling in midair
22,she was not listening
23,i looked toward the bed
31,something had happened to her
56,she lay on her back with the quilts up to her chin
39,only her head and shoulders were visible
41,her head moved slowly from side to side
107,from time to time she would open her mouth wide and i could see her tongue undulate faintly
97,cords of saliva would collect on her lips she would draw them in then open her mouth again
60,her mouth seemed to have a private existence of its own
97,it worked separate and apart from the rest of her out and in like a clam hole at low tide
84,occasionally it would say pt like some viscous substance coming to a boil
22,i pulled jems sleeve
31,he looked at me then at the bed
94,her head made its regular sweep toward us and jem said mrs dubose are you all right
23, she did not hear him
48,the alarm clock went off and scared us stiff
88,a minute later nerves still tingling jem and i were on the sidewalk headed for home
123,we did not run away jessie sent us before the clock wound down she was in the room pushing jem and me out of it
30,shoo she said you all go home
26, jem hesitated at the door
40,its time for her medicine jessie said
92,as the door swung shut behind us i saw jessie walking quickly toward mrs dubose s bed
143,it was only three fortyfive when we got home so jem and i dropkicked in the back yard until it was time to meet atticus
163,atticus had two yellow pencils for me and a football magazine for jem which i suppose was a silent reward for our first days session with mrs dubose
26,jem told him what happened
19,did she frighten you
15, asked atticus
35,no sir said jem but shes so nasty
25,she has fits or somethin
17,she spits a lot
20, she cant help that
55,when people are sick they dont look nice sometimes
23, she scared me i said
38,atticus looked at me over his glasses
39,you dont have to go with jem you know
391, the next afternoon at mrs dubose s was the same as the first and so was the next until gradually a pattern emerged everything would begin normally  that is mrs dubose would hound jem for a while on her favorite subjects her camellias and our fathers niggerloving propensities she would grow increasingly silent then go away from us
92,the alarm clock would ring jessie would shoo us out and the rest of the day was ours
59,atticus i said one evening what exactly is a niggerlover
25, atticuss face was grave
40,has somebody been calling you that
35, no sir mrs dubose calls you that
49,she warms up every afternoon calling you that
70,francis called me that last christmas thats where i first heard it
39, is that the reason you jumped on him
13, asked atticus
52,yes sir then why are you asking me what it means
134, i tried to explain to atticus that it wasnt so much what francis said that had infuriated me as the way he had said it
44,it was like hed said snotnose or somethin
107, scout said atticus niggerlover is just one of those terms that dont mean anything  like snotnose
140,its hard to explain  ignorant trashy people use it when they think somebodys favoring negroes over and above themselves
117,its slipped into usage with some people like ourselves when they want a common ugly term to label somebody
50, you arent really a niggerlover then are you
16, i certainly am
32,i do my best to love everybody
107,im hard put sometimes  baby its never an insult to be called what somebody thinks is a bad name
64,it just shows you how poor that person is it doesnt hurt you
36,so dont let mrs dubose get you down
35,she has enough troubles of her own
211, one afternoon a month later jem was ploughing his way through sir walter scout as jem called him and mrs dubose was correcting him at every turn when there was a knock on the door
14, she screamed
16,atticus came in
46,he went to the bed and took mrs duboses hand
64,i was coming from the office and didnt see the children he said
36,i thought they might still be here
27, mrs dubose smiled at him
127,for the life of me i could not figure out how she could bring herself to speak to him when she seemed to hate him so
38,do you know what time it is atticus
35,exactly fourteen minutes past five
37,the alarm clocks set for fivethirty
24,i want you to know that
238, it suddenly came to me that each day we had been staying a little longer at mrs duboses that the alarm clock went off a few minutes later every day and that she was well into one of her fits by the time it sounded
135,today she had antagonized jem for nearly two hours with no intention of having a fit and i felt hopelessly trapped
96,the alarm clock was the signal for our release if one day it did not ring what would we do
72,i have a feeling that jems reading days are numbered said atticus
56,only a week longer i think she said just to make sure
49,but atticus put out his hand and jem was silent
109,on the way home jem said he had to do it just for a month and the month was up and it wasnt fair
39,just one more week son said atticus
11,no said jem
17,yes said atticus
46,the following week found us back at mrs duboses
195,the alarm clock had ceased sounding but mrs dubose would release us with thatll do so late in the afternoon atticus would be home reading the paper when we returned
317,although her fits had passed off she was in every other way her old self when sir walter scott became involved in lengthy descriptions of moats and castles mrs dubose would become bored and pick on us jeremy finch i told you youd live to regret tearing up my camellias
28,you regret it now dont you
33, jem would say he certainly did
57,thought you could kill my snowonthe mountain did you
46,well jessie says the tops growing back out
53,next time youll know how to do it right wont you
42,youll pull it up by the roots wont you
33, jem would say he certainly would
24,dont you mutter at me boy
38,you hold up your head and say yes maam
80,dont guess you feel like holding it up though with your father what he is
93, jems chin would come up and he would gaze at mrs dubose with a face devoid of resentment
183,through the weeks he had cultivated an expression of polite and detached interest which he would present to her in answer to her most blood curdling inventions
20,at last the day came
73,when mrs dubose said thatll do one afternoon she added and thats all
15,goodday to you
12, it was over
80,we bounded down the sidewalk on a spree of sheer relief leaping and howling
92,that spring was a good one the days grew longer and gave us more playing time
114,jems mind was occupied mostly with the vital statistics of every college football player in the nation
72,every night atticus would read us the sports pages of the newspapers
132,alabama might go to the rose bowl again this year judging from its prospects not one of whose names we could pronounce
93,atticus was in the middle of windy seatons column one evening when the telephone rang
55,he answered it then went to the hat rack in the hall
55,im going down to mrs duboses for a while he said
15,i wont be long
52, but atticus stayed away until long past my bedtime
49,when he returned he was carrying a candy box
98,atticus sat down in the livingroom and put the box on the floor beside his chair
15,whatd she want
46,we had not seen mrs dubose for over a month
51,she was never on the porch any more when we passed
28,shes dead son said atticus
27,she died a few minutes ago
12, oh said jem
28, well is right said atticus
28,shes not suffering any more
30,she was sick for a long time
37,son didnt you know what her fits were
21, jem shook his head
53,mrs dubose was a morphine addict said atticus
40,she took it as a painkiller for years
23,the doctor put her on it
113,shed have spent the rest of her life on it and died without so much agony but she was too contrary   sir
77,atticus said just before your escapade she called me to make her will
57,dr reynolds told her she had only a few months left
104,her business affairs were in perfect order but she said theres still one thing out of order
14, what was that
20, jem was perplexed
78,she said she was going to leave this world beholden to nothing and nobody
115,jem when youre sick as she was its all right to take anything to make it easier but it wasnt all right for her
87,she said she meant to break herself of it before she died and thats what she did
47, jem said you mean thats what her fits were
27, yes thats what they were
84,most of the time you were reading to her i doubt if she heard a word you said
64,her whole mind and body were concentrated on that alarm clock
77,if you hadnt fallen into her hands id have made you go read to her anyway
34,it may have been some distraction
43,there was another reason   did she die free
38,as the mountain air said atticus
39,she was conscious to the last almost
37,conscious he smiled and cantankerous
126,she still disapproved heartily of my doings and said id probably spend the rest of my life bailing you out of jail
94,she had jessie fix you this box   atticus reached down and picked up the candy box
19,he handed it to jem
18,jem opened the box
74,inside surrounded by wads of damp cotton was a white waxy perfect camellia
30,it was a snowonthemountain
41,jems eyes nearly popped out of his head
30,old helldevil old helldevil
28, he screamed flinging it down
29,why cant she leave me alone
49, in a flash atticus was up and standing over him
48,jem buried his face in atticuss shirt front
11,shh he said
106,i think that was her way of telling you  everythings all right now jem everythings all right
31,you know she was a great lady
19, jem raised his head
21,his face was scarlet
50,after all those things she said about you a lady
72,she had her own views about things a lot different from mine maybe
87,son i told you that if you hadnt lost your head id have made you go read to her
184,i wanted you to see something about her  i wanted you to see what real courage is instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand
115,its when you know youre licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what
35,you rarely win but sometimes you do
50,mrs dubose won all ninetyeight pounds of her
66,according to her views she died beholden to nothing and nobody
42,she was the bravest person i ever knew
63, jem picked up the candy box and threw it in the fire
93,he picked up the camellia and when i went off to bed i saw him fingering the wide petals
32,atticus was reading the paper
63,part two contents  p rev  n ext chapter  jem was twelve
49,he was difficult to live with inconsistent moody
144,his appetite was appalling and he told me so many times to stop pestering him i consulted atticus reckon hes got a tapeworm
33, atticus said no jem was growing
70,i must be patient with him and disturb him as little as possible
60,this change in jem had come about in a matter of weeks
123,mrs dubose was not cold in her grave  jem had seemed grateful enough for my company when he went to read to her
184,overnight it seemed jem had acquired an alien set of values and was trying to impose them on me several times he went so far as to tell me what to do
93,after one altercation when jem hollered its time you started bein a girl and acting right
44, i burst into tears and fled to calpurnia
51,dont you fret too much over mister jem   she began
33, yeah hes just about mister jem now
25, he aint that old i said
75,all he needs is somebody to beat him up and i aint big enough
71, baby said calpurnia i just cant help it if mister jems growin up
145,hes gonna want to be off to himself a lot now doin whatever boys do so you just come right on in the kitchen when you feel lonesome
40,well find lots of things to do in here
112, the beginning of that summer boded well jem could do as he pleased calpurnia would do until dill came
157,she seemed glad to see me when i appeared in the kitchen and by watching her i began to think there was some skill involved in being a girl
41,but summer came and dill was not there
42,i received a letter and a snapshot from him
170,the letter said he had a new father whose picture was enclosed and he would have to stay in meridian because they planned to build a fishing boat
54,his father was a lawyer like atticus only much younger
104,dills new father had a pleasant face which made me glad dill had captured him but i was crushed
176,dill concluded by saying he would love me forever and not to worry he would come get me and marry me as soon as he got enough money together so please write
414,the fact that i had a permanent fiance was little compensation for his absence i had never thought about it but summer was dill by the fishpool smoking string dills eyes alive with complicated plans to make boo radley emerge summer was the swiftness with which dill would reach up and kiss me when jem was not looking the longings we sometimes felt each other feel
64,with him life was routine without him life was unbearable
33,i stayed miserable for two days
129,as if that were not enough the state legislature was called into emergency session and atticus left us for two weeks
202,the governor was eager to scrape a few barnacles off the ship of state there were sitdown strikes in birmingham bread lines in the cities grew longer people in the country grew poorer
62,but these were events remote from the world of jem and me
123,we were surprised one morning to see a cartoon in the montgomery advertiser above the caption maycombs finch
175, it showed atticus barefooted and in short pants chained to a desk he was diligently writing on a slate while some frivolous looking girls yelled yoohoo
33,thats a compliment explained jem
77,he spends his time doin things that wouldnt get done if nobody did em
105, in addition to jems newly developed characteristics he had acquired a maddening air of wisdom
77,oh scout its like reorganizing the tax systems of the counties and things
44,that kind of things pretty dry to most men
16, how do you know
28, oh go on and leave me alone
20,im readin the paper
18, jem got his wish
25,i departed for the kitchen
112,while she was shelling peas calpurnia suddenly said what am i gonna do about you alls church this sunday
17, nothing i reckon
27,atticus left us collection
89, calpurnia s eyes narrowed and i could tell what was going through her mind
34,cal i said you know well behave
47,we havent done anything in church in years
95, calpurnia evidently remembered a rainy sunday when we were both fatherless and teacherless
115,left to its own devices the class tied eunice ann simpson to a chair and placed her in the furnace room
390,we forgot her trooped upstairs to church and were listening quietly to the sermon when a dreadful banging issued from the radiator pipes persisting until someone investigated and brought forth eunice ann saying she didnt want to play shadrach any more  jem finch said she wouldnt get burnt if she had enough faith but it was hot down there
72,besides cal this isnt the first time atticus has left us i protested
60,yeah but he makes certain your teachers gonna be there
55,i didnt hear him say this time  reckon he forgot it
29, calpurnia scratched her head
20,suddenly she smiled
69,howd you and mister jem like to come to church with me tomorrow
12, how bout it
18, grinned calpurnia
136,if calpurnia had ever bathed me roughly before it was nothing compared to her supervision of that saturday nights routine
167,she made me soap all over twice drew fresh water in the tub for each rinse she stuck my head in the basin and washed it with octagon soap and castile
178,she had trusted jem for years but that night she invaded his privacy and provoked an outburst cant anybody take a bath in this house without the whole family lookin
70, next morning she began earlier than usual to go over our clothes
153, when calpurnia stayed overnight with us she slept on a folding cot in the kitchen that morning it was covered with our sunday habiliments
87,she had put so much starch in my dress it came up like a tent when i sat down
89,she made me wear a petticoat and she wrapped a pink sash tightly around my waist
100,she went over my patent leather shoes with a cold biscuit until she saw her face in them
48,its like we were goin to mardi gras said jem
23,whats all this for cal
84, i dont want anybody sayin i dont look after my children she muttered
64,mister jem you absolutely cant wear that tie with that suit
17, smarter with that
11, suits blue
14,cant you tell
35, hee hee i howled jems color blind
71, his face flushed angrily but calpurnia said now you all quit that
63,youre gonna go to first purchase with smiles on your faces
31, first purchase african me
92,church was in the quarters outside the southern town limits across the old sawmill tracks
203,it was an ancient paintpeeled frame building the only church in maycomb with a steeple and bell called first purchase because it was paid for from the first earnings of freed slaves
78,negroes worshiped in it on sundays and white men gambled in it on weekdays
67,the churchyard was brickhard clay as was the cemetery beside it
113,if someone died during a dry spell the body was covered with chunks of ice until rain softened the earth
168,a few graves in the cemetery were marked with crumbling tombstones newer ones were outlined with brightly colored glass and broken cocacola bottles
148,lightning rods guarding some graves denoted dead who rested uneasily stumps of burnedout candles stood at the heads of infant graves
25,it was a happy cemetery
214,the warm bittersweet smell of clean negro welcomed us as we entered the churchyard  hearts of love hairdressing mingled with asafoetida snuff hoyts cologne browns mule peppermint and lilac talcum
202,when they saw jem and me with calpurnia the men stepped back and took off their hats the women crossed their arms at their waists weekday gestures of respectful attention
68,they parted and made a small pathway to the church door for us
103,calpurnia walked between jem and me responding to the greetings of her brightly clad neighbors
23,what you up to miss cal
24, said a voice behind us
144,calpurnia s hands went to our shoulders and we stopped and looked around standing in the path behind us was a tall negro woman
121,her weight was on one leg she rested her left elbow in the curve of her hip pointing at us with upturned palm
97,she was bulletheaded with strange almondshaped eyes straight nose and an indianbow mouth
28,she seemed seven feet high
46,i felt calpurnia s hand dig into my shoulder
18,what you want lula
48, she asked in tones i had never heard her use
34,she spoke quietly contemptuously
68,i wants to know why you bringin white chillun to nigger church
33, theys my compny said calpurnia
77,again i thought her voice strange she was talking like the rest of them
63,yeah an i reckon yous compny at the finch house durin the week
32, a murmur ran through the crowd
90,dont you fret calpurnia whispered to me but the roses on her hat trembled indignantly
81,when lula came up the pathway toward us calpurnia said stop right there nigger
126, lula stopped but she said you aint got no business bringin white chillun here  they got their church we got ourn
33,it is our church aint it miss cal
41, calpurnia said its the same god aint it
97, jem said lets go home cal they dont want us here   i agreed they did not want us here
58,i sensed rather than saw that we were being advanced upon
118,they seemed to be drawing closer to us but when i looked up at calpurnia there was amusement in her eyes
51,when i looked down the pathway again lula was gone
51,in her place was a solid mass of colored people
34,one of them stepped from the crowd
36,it was zeebo the garbage collector
60,mister jem he said were mighty glad to have you all here
105,dont pay no tention to lula shes contentious because reverend sykes threatened to church her
117,shes a troublemaker from way back got fancy ideas an haughty ways  were mighty glad to have you all
126, with that calpurnia led us to the church door where we were greeted by reverend sykes who led us to the front pew
54,first purchase was unceiled and unpainted within
108,along its walls unlighted kerosene lamps hung on brass brackets pine benches served as pews
181,behind the rough oak pulpit a faded pink silk banner proclaimed god is love the churchs only decoration except a rotogravure print of hunts the light of the world
137,there was no sign of piano organ hymnbooks church programs  the familiar ecclesiastical impedimenta we saw every sunday
93,it was dim inside with a damp coolness slowly dispelled by the gathering congregation
150,at each seat was a cheap cardboard fan bearing a garish garden of gethsemane courtesy tyndals hardware co younameitwe sellit
89,calpurnia motioned jem and me to the end of the row and placed herself between us
107,she fished in her purse drew out her handkerchief and untied the hard wad of change in its corner
42,she gave a dime to me and a dime to jem
27,weve got ours he whispered
46,you keep it calpurnia said youre my company
157, jems face showed brief indecision on the ethics of withholding his own dime but his innate courtesy won and he shifted his dime to his pocket
31,i did likewise with no qualms
42,cal i whispered where are the hymnbooks
28, we dont have any she said
13, shh she said
86,reverend sykes was standing behind the pulpit staring the congregation to silence
156,he was a short stocky man in a black suit black tie white shirt and a gold watchchain that glinted in the light from the frosted windows
102,he said brethren and sisters we are particularly glad to have company with us this morning
22,mister and miss finch
26,you all know their father
49,before i begin i will read some announcements
85, reverend sykes shuffled some papers chose one and held it at arms length
87,the missionary society meets in the home of sister annette reeves next tuesday
16,bring your sewing
30, he read from another paper
47,you all know of brother tom robinsons trouble
73,he has been a faithful member of first purchase since he was a boy
131,the collection taken up today and for the next three sundays will go to helen  his wife to help her out at home
15, i punched jem
32,thats the tom atticuss de   shh
69, i turned to calpurnia but was hushed before i opened my mouth
106,subdued i fixed my attention upon reverend sykes who seemed to be waiting for me to settle down
68,will the music superintendent lead us in the first hymn he said
116,zeebo rose from his pew and walked down the center aisle stopping in front of us and facing the congregation
36,he was carrying a battered hymnbook
68,he opened it and said well sing number two seventythree
26, this was too much for me
53,howre we gonna sing it if there aint any hymn books
15, calpurnia smiled
52,hush baby she whispered youll see in a minute
127, zeebo cleared his throat and read in a voice like the rumble of distant artillery theres a land beyond the river
69, miraculously on pitch a hundred voices sang out zeebo s words
108,the last syllable held to a husky hum was followed by zeebo saying that we call the sweet forever
140, music again swelled around us the last note lingered and zeebo met it with the next line and we only reach that shore by faiths decree
87, the congregation hesitated zeebo repeated the line carefully and it was sung
99,at the chorus zeebo closed the book a signal for the congregation to proceed without his help
108,on the dying notes of jubilee zeebo said in that faroff sweet forever just beyond the shining river
109, line for line voices followed in simple harmony until the hymn ended in a melancholy murmur
74,i looked at jem who was looking at zeebo from the corners of his eyes
55,i didnt believe it either but we had both heard it
224,reverend sykes then called on the lord to bless the sick and the suffering a procedure no different from our church practice except reverend sykes directed the deitys attention to several specific cases
211,his sermon was a forthright denunciation of sin an austere declaration of the motto on the wall behind him he warned his flock against the evils of heady brews gambling and strange women
76,bootleggers caused enough trouble in the quarters but women were worse
150,again as i had often met it in my own church i was confronted with the impurity of women doctrine that seemed to preoccupy all clergymen
85,jem and i had heard the same sermon sunday after sunday with only one exception
374,reverend sykes used his pulpit more freely to express his views on individual lapses from grace jim hardy had been absent from church for five sundays and he wasnt sick constance jackson had better watch her ways  she was in grave danger for quarreling with her neighbors she had erected the only spite fence in the history of the quarters
36,reverend sykes closed his sermon
134,he stood beside a table in front of the pulpit and requested the morning offering a proceeding that was strange to jem and me
114,one by one the congregation came forward and dropped nickels and dimes into a black enameled coffee can
91,jem and i followed suit and received a soft thank you thank you as our dimes clinked
106,to our amazement reverend sykes emptied the can onto the table and raked the coins into his hand
79,he straightened up and said this is not enough we must have ten dollars
27, the congregation stirred
97,you all know what its for  helen cant leave those children to work while toms in jail
145,if everybody gives one more dime well have it   reverend sykes waved his hand and called to someone in the back of the church
19,alec shut the doors
45,nobody leaves here till we have ten dollars
84, calpurnia scratched in her handbag and brought forth a battered leather coin purse
78,naw cal jem whispered when she handed him a shiny quarter we can put ours in
23,gimme your dime scout
140, the church was becoming stuffy and it occurred to me that reverend sykes intended to sweat the amount due out of his flock
65,fans crackled feet shuffled tobaccochewers were in agony
106,reverend sykes startled me by saying sternly carlow richardson i havent seen you up this aisle yet
68, a thin man in khaki pants came up the aisle and deposited a coin
34,the congregation murmured approval
121,reverend sykes then said i want all of you with no children to make a sacrifice and give one more dime apiece
19,then well have it
49, slowly painfully the ten dollars was collected
58,the door was opened and the gust of warm air revived us
65,zeebo lined on jordans stormy banks and church was over
91,i wanted to stay and explore but calpurnia propelled me up the aisle ahead of her
124,at the church door while she paused to talk with zeebo and his family jem and i chatted with reverend sykes
90,i was bursting with questions but decided i would wait and let calpurnia answer them
68,we were specially glad to have you all here said reverend sykes
49,this church has no better friend than your daddy
83, my curiosity burst why were you all takin up collection for tom robinsons wife
19, didnt you hear why
22, asked reverend sykes
108,helens got three littleuns and she cant go out to work   why cant she take em with her reverend
209,it was customary for field negroes with tiny children to deposit them in whatever shade there was while their parents worked  usually the babies sat in the shade between two rows of cotton
116,those unable to sit were strapped papoosestyle on their mothers backs or resided in extra cotton bags
25,reverend sykes hesitated
103,to tell you the truth miss jean louise helens finding it hard to get work these days
51,when its picking time i think mr link deasu take her
17, why not reverend
69, before he could answer i felt calpurnias hand on my shoulder
58,at its pressure i said we thank you for lettin us come
49, jem echoed me and we made our way homeward
94,cal i know tom robinsons in jail an hes done somethin awful but why wont folks hire helen
83,calpurnia in her navy voile dress and tub of a hat walked between jem and me
51,its because of what folks say toms done she said
75,folks arent anxious to  to have anything to do with any of his family
25, just what did he do cal
18, calpurnia sighed
94,old mr bob ewell accused him of rapin his girl an had him arrested an put in jail   mr
17, my memory stirred
107,does he have anything to do with those ewells that come every first day of school an then go home
126,why atticus said they were absolute trash  i never heard atticus talk about folks the way he talked about the ewells
32,he said yeah those are the ones
111, well if everybody in maycomb knows what kind of folks the ewells are theyd be glad to hire helen
14,whats rape cal
58, its somethin youll have to ask mr finch about she said
38,he can explain it better than i can
14,you all hungry
87,the reverend took a long time unwindin this morning hes not usually so tedious
84, hes just like our preacher said jem but why do you all sing hymns that way
19,is that what it is
24, yeah its called linin
47,theyve done it that way as long as i can remember
106, jem said it looked like they could save the collection money for a year and get some hymnbooks
17,calpurnia laughed
30,wouldnt do any good she said
15,they cant read
16,all those folks
31, thats right calpurnia nodded
49,cant but about four folks in first purchase read
12,im one of em
30, whered you go to school cal
37,lets see now who taught me my letters
74,it was miss maudie atkinsons aunt old miss buford   are you that old
30, im older than mr finch even
19, calpurnia grinned
25,not sure how much though
235,we started rememberin one time trying to figure out how old i was  i can remember back just a few years moren he can so im not much older when you take off the fact that men cant remember as well as women
24, whats your birthday cal
94, i just have it on christmas its easier to remember that way  i dont have a real birthday
75, but cal jem protested you dont look even near as old as atticus
55, colored folks dont show their ages so fast she said
31,maybe because they cant read
25,cal did you teach zeebo
15, yeah mister jem
48,there wasnt a school even when he was a boy
23,i made him learn though
33, zeebo was calpurnia s eldest son
180,if i had ever thought about it i would have known that calpurnia was of mature years  zeebo had halfgrown children  but then i had never thought about it
44,did you teach him out of a primer like us
158,no i made him get a page of the bible every day and there was a book miss buford taught me out of  bet you dont know where i got it she said
13,we didnt know
58,calpurnia said your granddaddy finch gave it to me
27, were you from the landing
22,you never told us that
26, i certainly am mister jem
65,grew up down there between the buford place and the landin
129,ive spent all my days workin for the finches or the bufords an i moved to maycomb when your daddy and your mamma married
23, what was the book cal
26,blackstones commentaries
22, jem was thunderstruck
39,you mean you taught zeebo outa that
24, why yes sir mister jem
47, calpurnia timidly put her fingers to her mouth
31,they were the only books i had
129,your grandaddy said mr blackstone wrote fine english   thats why you dont talk like the rest of em said jem
13,the rest of who
27, rest of the colored folks
47,cal but you talked like they did in church
65, that calpurnia led a modest double life never dawned on me
151,the idea that she had a separate existence outside our household was a novel one to say nothing of her having command of two languages
94,cal i asked why do you talk nigger talk to the  to your folks when you know its not right
118, well in the first place im black that doesnt mean you hafta talk that way when you know better said jem
105,calpurnia tilted her hat and scratched her head then pressed her hat down carefully over her ears
32,its right hard to say she said
97,suppose you and scout talked colored folks talk at home itd be out of place wouldnt it
76,now what if i talked whitefolks talk at church and with my neighbors
46,theyd think i was puttin on airs to beat moses
32, but cal you know better i said
41,its not necessary to tell all you know
113,its not ladylike  in the second place folks dont like to have somebody around knowin more than they do
16,it aggravates em
235,youre not gonna change any of them by talkin right theyve got to want to learn themselves and when they dont want to learn theres nothing you can do but keep your mouth shut or talk their language
39, cal can i come to see you sometimes
23, she looked down at me
11,see me honey
22,you see me every day
25, out to your house i said
19,sometimes after work
18,atticus can get me
30, any time you want to she said
25,wed be glad to have you
46, we were on the sidewalk by the radley place
35,look on the porch yonder jem said
117,i looked over to the radley place expecting to see its phantom occupant sunning himself in the swing
18,the swing was empty
26,i mean our porch said jem
28,i looked down the street
150,enarmored upright uncompromising aunt alexandra was sitting in a rocking chair exactly as if she had sat there every day of her life
125,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  put my bag in the front bedroom calpurnia was the first thing aunt alexandra said
69,jean louise stop scratching your head was the second thing she said
64,calpurnia picked up auntys heavy suitcase and opened the door
34,ill take it said jem and took it
61,i heard the suitcase hit the bedroom floor with a thump
47,the sound had a dull permanence about it
32,have you come for a visit aunty
84,aunt alexandras visits from the landing were rare and she traveled in state
176,she owned a bright green square buick and a black chauffeur both kept in an unhealthy state of tidiness but today they were nowhere to be seen
27,didnt your father tell you
25,jem and i shook our heads
19,probably he forgot
21,hes not in yet is he
69, nome he doesnt usually get back till late afternoon said jem
85,well your father and i decided it was time i came to stay with you for a while
78, for a while in maycomb meant anything from three days to thirty years
29,jem and i exchanged glances
55,jems growing up now and you are too she said to me
78,we decided that it would be best for you to have some feminine influence
318,it wont be many years jean louise before you become interested in clothes and boys   i could have made several answers to this cals a girl it would be many years before i would be interested in boys i would never be interested in clothes
15,but i kept quiet
22,what about uncle jimmy
16,is he comin too
37, oh no hes staying at the landing
26,hell keep the place going
41, the moment i said wont you miss him
49, i realized that this was not a tactful question
97,uncle jimmy present or uncle jimmy absent made not much difference he never said anything
35,aunt alexandra ignored my question
46,i could think of nothing else to say to her
149,in fact i could never think of anything to say to her and i sat thinking of past painful conversations between us how are you jean louise
32,fine thank you maam how are you
61,very well thank you what have you been doing with yourself
22,dont you do anything
26,certainly you have friends
23,well what do you all do
127,it was plain that aunty thought me dull in the extreme because i once heard her tell atticus that i was sluggish
86,there was a story behind all this but i had no desire to extract it from her then
84,today was sunday and aunt alexandra was positively irritable on the lords day
33,i guess it was her sunday corset
243,she was not fat but solid and she chose protective garments that drew up her bosom to giddy heights pinched in her waist flared out her rear and managed to suggest that aunt alexandras was once an hourglass figure
34,from any angle it was formidable
174,the remainder of the afternoon went by in the gentle gloom that descends when relatives appear but was dispelled when we heard a car turn in the driveway
38,it was atticus home from montgomery
53,jem forgetting his dignity ran with me to meet him
125,jem seized his briefcase and bag i jumped into his arms felt his vague dry kiss and said d you bring me a book
23,d you know auntys here
54, atticus answered both questions in the affirmative
44,howd you like for her to come live with us
153, i said i would like it very much which was a lie but one must lie under certain circumstances and at all times when one cant do anything about them
87,we felt it was time you children needed  well its like this scout atticus said
50,your aunts doing me a favor as well as you all
78,i cant stay here all day with you and the summers going to be a hot one
51, yes sir i said not understanding a word he said
114,i had an idea however that aunt alexandras appearance on the scene was not so much atticuss doing as hers
125,aunty had a way of declaring what is best for the family and i suppose her coming to live with us was in that category
21,maycomb welcomed her
250,miss maudie atkinson baked a lane cake so loaded with shinny it made me tight miss stephanie crawford had long visits with aunt alexandra consisting mostly of miss stephanie shaking her head and saying uh uh uh
196, miss rachel next door had aunty over for coffee in the afternoons and mr nathan radley went so far as to come up in the front yard and say he was glad to see her
128,when she settled in with us and life resumed its daily pace aunt alexandra seemed as if she had always lived with us
294,her missionary society refreshments added to her reputation as a hostess she did not permit calpurnia to make the delicacies required to sustain the society through long reports on rice christians she joined and became secretary of the maycomb amanuensis club
300,to all parties present and participating in the life of the county aunt alexandra was one of the last of her kind she had riverboat boardingschool manners let any moral come along and she would uphold it she was born in the objective case she was an incurable gossip
115,when aunt alexandra went to school selfdoubt could not be found in any textbook so she knew not its meaning
148,she was never bored and given the slightest chance she would exercise her royal prerogative she would arrange advise caution and warn
285,she never let a chance escape her to point out the shortcomings of other tribal groups to the greater glory of our own a habit that amused jem rather than annoyed him aunty better watch how she talks  scratch most folks in maycomb and theyre kin to us
140, aunt alexandra in underlining the moral of young sam merriweathers suicide said it was caused by a morbid streak in the family
140,let a sixteenyearold girl giggle in the choir and aunty would say it just goes to show you all the penfield women are flighty
114, everybody in maycomb it seemed had a streak a drinking streak a gambling streak a mean streak a funny streak
273,once when aunty assured us that miss stephanie crawfords tendency to mind other peoples business was hereditary atticus said sister when you stop to think about it our generations practically the first in the finch family not to marry its cousins
55,would you say the finches have an incestuous streak
65, aunty said no thats where we got our small hands and feet
52,i never understood her preoccupation with heredity
279,somewhere i had received the impression that fine folks were people who did the best they could with the sense they had but aunt alexandra was of the opinion obliquely expressed that the longer a family had been squatting on one patch of land the finer it was
49,that makes the ewells fine folks then said jem
204,the tribe of which burris ewell and his brethren consisted had lived on the same plot of earth behind the maycomb dump and had thrived on county welfare money for three generations
56,aunt alexandras theory had something behind it though
29,maycomb was an ancient town
89,it was twenty miles east of finchs landing awkwardly inland for such an old town
220,but maycomb would have been closer to the river had it not been for the nimble wittedness of one sinkfield who in the dawn of history operated an inn where two pigtrails met the only tavern in the territory
227,sinkfield no patriot served and supplied ammunition to indians and settlers alike neither knowing or caring whether he was a part of the alabama territory or the creek nation so long as business was good
263,business was excellent when governor william wyatt bibb with a view to promoting the newly created countys domestic tranquility dispatched a team of surveyors to locate its exact center and there establish its seat of government
198,the surveyors sinkfields guests told their host that he was in the territorial confines of maycomb county and showed him the probable spot where the county seat would be built
159,had not sinkfield made a bold stroke to preserve his holdings maycomb would have sat in the middle of winston swamp a place totally devoid of interest
323,instead maycomb grew and sprawled out from its hub sinkfields tavern because sinkfield reduced his guests to myopic drunkenness one evening induced them to bring forward their maps and charts lop off a little here add a bit there and adjust the center of the county to meet his requirements
156,he sent them packing next day armed with their charts and five quarts of shinny in their saddlebags  two apiece and one for the governor
149,because its primary reason for existence was government maycomb was spared the grubbiness that distinguished most alabama towns its size
97,in the beginning its buildings were solid its courthouse proud its streets graciously wide
202,maycomb s proportion of professional people ran high one went there to have his teeth pulled his wagon fixed his heart listened to his money deposited his soul saved his mules vetted
75,but the ultimate wisdom of sinkfields maneuver is open to question
245,he placed the young town too far away from the only kind of public transportation in those days  riverboat  and it took a man from the north end of the county two days to travel to maycomb for store bought goods
134,as a result the town remained the same size for a hundred years an island in a patchwork sea of cottonfields and timberland
142,although maycomb was ignored during the war between the states reconstruction rule and economic ruin forced the town to grow
14,it grew inward
148,new people so rarely settled there the same families married the same families until the members of the community looked faintly alike
166,occasionally someone would return from montgomery or mobile with an outsider but the result caused only a ripple in the quiet stream of family resemblance
61,things were more or less the same during my early years
389,there was indeed a caste system in maycomb but to my mind it worked this way the older citizens the present generation of people who had lived side by side for years and years were utterly predictable to one another they took for granted attitudes character shadings even gestures as having been repeated in each generation and refined by time
512,thus the dicta no crawford minds his own business every third merriweather is morbid the truth is not in the delafields all the bufords walk like that were simply guides to daily living never take a check from a delafield without a discreet call to the bank miss maudie atkinsons shoulder stoops because she was a buford if mrs grace merriweather sips gin out of lydia e pinkham bottles its nothing unusual  her mother did the same
118,aunt alexandra fitted into the world of maycomb like a hand into a glove but never into the world of jem and me
192,i so often wondered how she could be atticuss and uncle jacks sister that i revived halfremembered tales of changelings and mandrake roots that jem had spun long ago
189,these were abstract speculations for the first month of her stay as she had little to say to jem or me and we saw her only at mealtimes and at night before we went to bed
38,it was summer and we were outdoors
234,of course some afternoons when i would run inside for a drink of water i would find the livingroom overrun with maycomb ladies sipping whispering fanning and i would be called jean louise come speak to these ladies
140, when i appeared in the doorway aunty would look as if she regretted her request i was usually mudsplashed or covered with sand
90,speak to your cousin lily she said one afternoon when she had trapped me in the hall
49,your cousin lily brooke said aunt alexandra
15,she our cousin
19,i didnt know that
124, aunt alexandra managed to smile in a way that conveyed a gentle apology to cousin lily and firm disapproval to me
59,when cousin lily brooke left i knew i was in for it
137,it was a sad thing that my father had neglected to tell me about the finch family or to install any pride into his children
56,she summoned jem who sat warily on the sofa beside me
131,she left the room and returned with a purplecovered book on which meditations of joshua s st clair was stamped in gold
45,your cousin wrote this said aunt alexandra
27,he was a beautiful character
31, jem examined the small volume
60,is this the cousin joshua who was locked up for so long
45, aunt alexandra said how did you know that
60, why atticus said he went round the bend at the university
39,said he tried to shoot the president
162,said cousin joshua said he wasnt anything but a sewer inspector and tried to shoot him with an old flintlock pistol only it just blew up in his hand
137,atticus said it cost the family five hundred dollars to get him out of that one aunt alexandra was standing stiff as a stork
20,thats all she said
19,well see about this
98, before bedtime i was in jems room trying to borrow a book when atticus knocked and entered
73,he sat on the side of jems bed looked at us soberly then he grinned
17, er  hrm he said
149,he was beginning to preface some things he said with a throaty noise and i thought he must at last be getting old but he looked the same
44,i dont exactly know how to say this he began
26,well just say it said jem
23,have we done something
36, our father was actually fidgeting
75,no i just want to explain to you that  your aunt alexandra asked me
37,son you know youre a finch dont you
27, thats what ive been told
49, jem looked out of the corners of his eyes
56,his voice rose uncontrollably atticus whats the matter
52, atticus crossed his knees and folded his arms
41,im trying to tell you the facts of life
23, jems disgust deepened
29,i know all that stuff he said
32,atticus suddenly grew serious
316,in his lawyers voice without a shade of inflection he said your aunt has asked me to try and impress upon you and jean louise that you are not from runofthemill people that you are the product of several generations gentle breeding   atticus paused watching me locate an elusive redbug on my leg
266,gentle breeding he continued when i had found and scratched it and that you should try to live up to your name   atticus persevered in spite of us she asked me to tell you you must try to behave like the little lady and gentleman that you are
231,she wants to talk to you about the family and what its meant to maycomb county through the years so youll have some idea of who you are so you might be moved to behave accordingly he concluded at a gallop
96,stunned jem and i looked at each other then at atticus whose collar seemed to worry him
23,we did not speak to him
88,presently i picked up a comb from jems dresser and ran its teeth along the edge
30,stop that noise atticus said
21,his curtness stung me
61,the comb was midway in its journey and i banged it down
73,for no reason i felt myself beginning to cry but i could not stop
24,this was not my father
38,my father never thought these thoughts
24,my father never spoke so
47,aunt alexandra had put him up to this somehow
104,through my tears i saw jem standing in a similar pool of isolation his head cocked to one side
77,there was nowhere to go but i turned to go and met atticuss vest front
224,i buried my head in it and listened to the small internal noises that went on behind the light blue cloth his watch ticking the faint crackle of his starched shirt the soft sound of his breathing
31,your stomachs growling i said
19,i know it he said
27,you better take some soda
13, i will he said
68,atticus is all this behavin an stuff gonna make things different
14,i mean are you 
41, i felt his hand on the back of my head
41,dont you worry about anything he said
21,its not time to worry
55, when i heard that i knew he had come back to us
66,the blood in my legs began to flow again and i raised my head
31,you really want us to do all that
59,i cant remember everything finches are supposed to do
29, i dont want you to remember it
76, he went to the door and out of the room shutting the door behind him
85,he nearly slammed it but caught himself at the last minute and closed it softly
76,as jem and i stared the door opened again and atticus peered around
51,his eyebrows were raised his glasses had slipped
45,get more like cousin joshua every day dont i
69,do you think ill end up costing the family five hundred dollars
67, i know now what he was trying to do but atticus was only a man
43,it takes a woman to do that kind of work
140,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  although we heard no more about the finch family from aunt alexandra we heard plenty from the town
289,on saturdays armed with our nickels when jem permitted me to accompany him he was now positively allergic to my presence when in public we would squirm our way through sweating sidewalk crowds and sometimes hear theres his chillun or yonders some finches
133, turning to face our accusers we would see only a couple of farmers studying the enema bags in the mayco drugstore window
72,or two dumpy countrywomen in straw hats sitting in a hoover cart
185,they cn go loose and rape up the countryside for all of em who run this county care was one obscure observation we met head on from a skinny gentleman when he passed us
61,which reminded me that i had a question to ask atticus
24, i asked him that night
46,atticus looked around from behind his paper
29,he was in his chair by the window
111,as we grew older jem and i thought it generous to allow atticus thirty minutes to himself after supper
94,he sighed and said rape was carnal knowledge of a female by force and without consent
89,well if thats all it is why did calpurnia dry me up when i asked her what it was
25, atticus looked pensive
14,whats that again
131, well i asked calpurnia comin from church that day what it was and she said ask you but i forgot to and now im askin you
32, his paper was now in his lap
20,again please he said
65,i told him in detail about our trip to church with calpurnia
148,atticus seemed to enjoy it but aunt alexandra who was sitting in a corner quietly sewing put down her embroidery and stared at us
62,you all were coming back from calpurnias church that sunday
29, jem said yessum she took us
24, i remembered something
74,yessum and she promised me i could come out to her house some afternoon
46,ill go next sunday if its all right can i
60,cal said shed come get me if you were off in the car
11, you may not
26, aunt alexandra said it
147,i wheeled around startled then turned back to atticus in time to catch his swift glance at her but it was too late
22,i said i didnt ask you
94, for a big man atticus could get up and down from a chair faster than anyone i ever knew
19,he was on his feet
33,apologize to your aunt he said
102,i didnt ask her i asked you   atticus turned his head and pinned me to the wall with his good eye
53,his voice was deadly first apologize to your aunt
29, im sorry aunty i muttered
17,now then he said
166,lets get this clear you do as calpurnia tells you you do as i tell you and as long as your aunts in this house you will do as she tells you
218, i understood pondered a while and concluded that the only way i could retire with a shred of dignity was to go to the bathroom where i stayed long enough to make them think i had to go
93,returning i lingered in the hall to hear a fierce discussion going on in the livingroom
168,through the door i could see jem on the sofa with a football magazine in front of his face his head turning as if its pages contained a live tennis match
56,youve got to do something about her aunty was saying
48,youve let things go on too long atticus too long
54, i dont see any harm in letting her go out there
53,cald look after her there as well as she does here
42, who was the her they were talking about
15,my heart sank me
147,i felt the starched walls of a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on me and for the second time in my life i thought of running away
11,immediately
104,atticus its all right to be softhearted youre an easy man but you have a daughter to think of
27,a daughter whos growing up
28, thats what i am thinking of
33, and dont try to get around it
73,youve got to face it sooner or later and it might as well be tonight
22,we dont need her now
98, atticus s voice was even alexandra calpurnias not leaving this house until she wants to
92,you may think otherwise but i couldnt have got along without her all these years
104,shes a faithful member of this family and youll simply have to accept things the way they are
94,besides sister i dont want you working your head off for us  youve no reason to do that
49,we still need cal as much as we ever did
109, but atticus besides i dont think the childrenve suffered one bit from her having brought them up
87,if anything shes been harder on them in some ways than a mother would have been
111,shes never let them get away with anything shes never indulged them the way most colored nurses do
134,she tried to bring them up according to her lights and cals lights are pretty good  and another thing the children love her
17, i breathed again
64,it wasnt me it was only calpurnia they were talking about
35,revived i entered the livingroom
97,atticus had retreated behind his newspaper and aunt alexandra was worrying her embroidery
50,punk punk punk her needle broke the taut circle
54,she stopped and pulled the cloth tighter punkpunkpunk
16,she was furious
40,jem got up and padded across the rug
27,he motioned me to follow
44,he led me to his room and closed the door
19,his face was grave
26,theyve been fussing scout
116, jem and i fussed a great deal these days but i had never heard of or seen anyone quarrel with atticus
30,it was not a comfortable sight
39,scout try not to antagonize aunty hear
92, atticuss remarks were still rankling which made me miss the request in jems question
22,my feathers rose again
32,you tryin to tell me what to do
68, naw its  hes got a lot on his mind now without us worrying him
67, atticus didnt appear to have anything especially on his mind
107,its this tom robinson case thats worryin him to death   i said atticus didnt worry about anything
90,besides the case never bothered us except about once a week and then it didnt last
87,thats because you cant hold something in your mind but a little while said jem
97,its different with grown folks we   his maddening superiority was unbearable these days
69,he didnt want to do anything but read and go off by himself
162,still everything he read he passed along to me but with this difference formerly because he thought id like it now for my edification and instruction
22,jee crawling hova jem
