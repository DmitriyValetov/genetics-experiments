34,to kill a mockingbird by harper lee
119,dedication for mr lee and alice in consideration of love affection lawyers i suppose were children once
108,charles lamb chapter  when he was nearly thirteen my brother jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow
142,when it healed and jems fears of never being able to play football were assuaged he was seldom selfconscious about his injury
184,his left arm was somewhat shorter than his right when he stood or walked the back of his hand was at right angles to his body his thumb parallel to his thigh
65,he couldnt have cared less so long as he could pass and punt
130,when enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident
126,i maintain that the ewells started it all but jem who was four years my senior said it started long before that
120,he said it began the summer dill came to us when dill first gave us the idea of making boo radley come out
91,i said if he wanted to take a broad view of the thing it really began with andrew jackson
156,if general jackson hadnt run the creeks up the creek simon finch would never have paddled up the alabama and where would we be if he hadnt
89,we were far too old to settle an argument with a fistfight so we consulted atticus
38,our father said we were both right
161,being southerners it was a source of shame to some members of the family that we had no recorded ancestors on either side of the battle of hastings
126,all we had was simon finch a furtrapping apothecary from cornwall whose piety was exceeded only by his stinginess
329,in england simon was irritated by the persecution of those who called themselves methodists at the hands of their more liberal brethren and as simon called himself a methodist he worked his way across the atlantic to philadelphia thence to jamaica thence to mobile and up the saint stephens
299,mindful of john wesleys strictures on the use of many words in buying and selling simon made a pile practicing medicine but in this pursuit he was unhappy lest he be tempted into doing what he knew was not for the glory of god as the putting on of gold and costly apparel
258,so simon having forgotten his teachers dictum on the possession of human chattels bought three slaves and with their aid established a homestead on the banks of the alabama river some forty miles above saint stephens
125,he returned to saint stephens only once to find a wife and with her established a line that ran high to daughters
47,simon lived to an impressive age and died rich
134,it was customary for the men in the family to remain on simons homestead finchs landing and make their living from cotton
259,the place was selfsufficient modest in comparison with the empires around it the landing nevertheless produced everything required to sustain life except ice wheat flour and articles of clothing supplied by riverboats from mobile
413,simon would have regarded with impotent fury the disturbance between the north and the south as it left his descendants stripped of everything but their land yet the tradition of living on the land remained unbroken until well into the twentieth century when my father atticus finch went to montgomery to read law and his younger brother went to boston to study medicine
215,their sister alexandra was the finch who remained at the landing she married a taciturn man who spent most of his time lying in a hammock by the river wondering if his trotlines were full
91,when my father was admitted to the bar he returned to maycomb and began his practice
92,maycomb some twenty miles east of finchs landing was the county seat of maycomb county
148,atticuss office in the courthouse contained little more than a hat rack a spittoon a checkerboard and an unsullied code of alabama
90,his first two clients were the last two persons hanged in the maycomb county jail
247,atticus had urged them to accept the states generosity in allowing them to plead guilty to seconddegree murder and escape with their lives but they were haverfords in maycomb county a name synonymous with jackass
311,the haverfords had dispatched maycomb s leading blacksmith in a misunderstanding arising from the alleged wrongful detention of a mare were imprudent enough to do it in the presence of three witnesses and insisted that thesonofabitchhadit comingtohim was a good enough defense for anybody
316,they persisted in pleading not guilty to firstdegree murder so there was nothing much atticus could do for his clients except be present at their departure an occasion that was probably the beginning of my fathers profound distaste for the practice of criminal law
186,during his first five years in maycomb atticus practiced economy more than anything for several years thereafter he invested his earnings in his brothers education
239,john hale finch was ten years younger than my father and chose to study medicine at a time when cotton was not worth growing but after getting uncle jack started atticus derived a reasonable income from the law
235,he liked maycomb he was maycomb county born and bred he knew his people they knew him and because of simon finchs industry atticus was related by blood or marriage to nearly every family in the town
79,maycomb was an old town but it was a tired old town when i first knew it
118,in rainy weather the streets turned to red slop grass grew on the sidewalks the courthouse sagged in the square
186,somehow it was hotter then a black dog suffered on a summers day bony mules hitched to hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square
52,mens stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning
158,ladies bathed before noon after their threeoclock naps and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum
24,people moved slowly then
116,they ambled across the square shuffled in and out of the stores around it took their time about everything
52,a day was twentyfour hours long but seemed longer
162,there was no hurry for there was nowhere to go nothing to buy and no money to buy it with nothing to see outside the boundaries of maycomb county
155,but it was a time of vague optimism for some of the people maycomb county had recently been told that it had nothing to fear but fear itself
98,we lived on the main residential street in town  atticus jem and i plus calpurnia our cook
117,jem and i found our father satisfactory he played with us read to us and treated us with courteous detachment
37,calpurnia was something else again
121,she was all angles and bones she was nearsighted she squinted her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard
193,she was always ordering me out of the kitchen asking me why i couldnt behave as well as jem when she knew he was older and calling me home when i wasnt ready to come
35,our battles were epic and onesided
66,calpurnia always won mainly because atticus always took her side
126,she had been with us ever since jem was born and i had felt her tyrannical presence as long as i could remember
64,our mother died when i was two so i never felt her absence
111,she was a graham from montgomery atticus met her when he was first elected to the state legislature
55,he was middleaged then she was fifteen years his junior
162,jem was the product of their first year of marriage four years later i was born and two years later our mother died from a sudden heart attack
30,they said it ran in her family
40,i did not miss her but i think jem did
160,he remembered her clearly and sometimes in the middle of a game he would sigh at length then go off and play by himself behind the carhouse
56,when he was like that i knew better than to bother him
250,when i was almost six and jem was nearly ten our summertime boundaries within calling distance of calpurnia were mrs henry lafayette duboses house two doors to the north of us and the radley place three doors to the south
36,we were never tempted to break them
168,the radley place was inhabited by an unknown entity the mere description of whom was enough to make us behave for days on end mrs dubose was plain hell
37,that was the summer dill came to us
156,early one morning as we were beginning our days play in the back yard jem and i heard something next door in miss rachel haverfords collard patch
155,we went to the wire fence to see if there was a puppy  miss rachels rat terrier was expecting  instead we found someone sitting looking at us
54,sitting down he wasnt much higher than the collards
36,we stared at him until he spoke hey
37, hey yourself said jem pleasantly
35,im charles baker harris he said
43,i just thought youd like to know i can read
87,you got anything needs readin i can do it how old are you asked jem fourandahalf
14, goin on seven
60, shoot no wonder then said jem jerking his thumb at me
99,scout yonders been readin ever since she was born and she aint even started to school yet
40,you look right puny for goin on seven
32, im little but im old he said
48,jem brushed his hair back to get a better look
45,why dont you come over charles baker harris
16,lord what a name
25, s not any funniern yours
51,aunt rachel says your names jeremy atticus finch
11, jem scowled
38,im big enough to fit mine he said
26,your names longer n you are
23,bet its a foot longer
62, folks call me dill said dill struggling under the fence
57,do better if you go over it instead of under it i said
22,where d you come from
164, dill was from meridian mississippi was spending the summer with his aunt miss rachel and would be spending every summer in maycomb from now on
184,his family was from maycomb county originally his mother worked for a photographer in meridian had entered his picture in a beautiful child contest and won five dollars
85,she gave the money to dill who went to the picture show twenty times on it
102,dont have any picture shows here except jesus ones in the courthouse sometimes said jem
22,ever see anything good
103, dill had seen dracula a revelation that moved jem to eye him with the beginning of respect
22,tell it to us he said
22,dill was a curiosity
187,he wore blue linen shorts that buttoned to his shirt his hair was snow white and stuck to his head like duckfluff he was a year my senior but i towered over him
178,as he told us the old tale his blue eyes would lighten and darken his laugh was sudden and happy he habitually pulled at a cowlick in the center of his forehead
168,when dill reduced dracula to dust and jem said the show sounded better than the book i asked dill where his father was you aint said anything about him
16, i havent got one
8, is he dead
52, no then if hes not dead youve got one havent you
108, dill blushed and jem told me to hush a sure sign that dill had been studied and found acceptable
56,thereafter the summer passed in routine contentment
261,routine contentment was improving our treehouse that rested between giant twin chinaberry trees in the back yard fussing running through our list of dramas based on the works of oliver optic victor appleton and edgar rice burroughs
41,in this matter we were lucky to have dill
136,he played the character parts formerly thrust upon me  the ape in tarzan mr crabtree in the rover boys mr damon in tom swift
127,thus we came to know dill as a pocket merlin whose head teemed with eccentric plans strange longings and quaint fancies
171,but by the end of august our repertoire was vapid from countless reproductions and it was then that dill gave us the idea of making boo radley come out
37,the radley place fascinated dill
201,in spite of our warnings and explanations it drew him as the moon draws water but drew him no nearer than the lightpole on the corner a safe distance from the radley gate
80,there he would stand his arm around the fat pole staring and wondering
61,the radley place jutted into a sharp curve beyond our house
81,walking south one faced its porch the sidewalk turned and ran beside the lot
160,the house was low was once white with a deep front porch and green shutters but had long ago darkened to the color of the slategray yard around it
86,rainrotted shingles drooped over the eaves of the veranda oak trees kept the sun away
165,the remains of a picket drunkenly guarded the front yard  a swept yard that was never swept  where johnson grass and rabbittobacco grew in abundance
46,inside the house lived a malevolent phantom
59,people said he existed but jem and i had never seen him
87,people said he went out at night when the moon was down and peeped in windows
88,when peoples azaleas froze in a cold snap it was because he had breathed on them
66,any stealthy small crimes committed in maycomb were his work
340,once the town was terrorized by a series of morbid nocturnal events peoples chickens and household pets were found mutilated although the culprit was crazy addie who eventually drowned himself in barkers eddy people still looked at the radley place unwilling to discard their initial suspicions
128,a negro would not pass the radley place at night he would cut across to the sidewalk opposite and whistle as he walked
242,the maycomb school grounds adjoined the back of the radley lot from the radley chickenyard tall pecan trees shook their fruit into the schoolyard but the nuts lay untouched by the children radley pecans would kill you
86,a baseball hit into the radley yard was a lost ball and no questions asked
73,the misery of that house began many years before jem and i were born
99,the radleys welcome anywhere in town kept to themselves a predilection unforgivable in maycomb
255,they did not go to church maycombs principal recreation but worshiped at home mrs radley seldom if ever crossed the street for a midmorning coffee break with her neighbors and certainly never joined a missionary circle
210,mr radley walked to town at eleventhirty every morning and came back promptly at twelve sometimes carrying a brown paper bag that the neighborhood assumed contained the family groceries
235,i never knew how old mr radley made his living  jem said he bought cotton a polite term for doing nothing  but mr radley and his wife had lived there with their two sons as long as anybody could remember
171,the shutters and doors of the radley house were closed on sundays another thing alien to maycombs ways closed doors meant illness and cold weather only
129,of all days sunday was the day for formal afternoon visiting ladies wore corsets men wore coats children wore shoes
124,but to climb the radley front steps and call hey of a sunday afternoon was something their neighbors never did
36,the radley house had no screen doors
84,i once asked atticus if it ever had any atticus said yes but before i was born
328,according to neighborhood legend when the younger radley boy was in his teens he became acquainted with some of the cunninghams from old sarum an enormous and confusing tribe domiciled in the northern part of the county and they formed the nearest thing to a gang ever seen in maycomb
394,they did little but enough to be discussed by the town and publicly warned from three pulpits they hung around the barbershop they rode the bus to abbottsville on sundays and went to the picture show they attended dances at the countys riverside gambling hell the dewdrop inn amp fishing camp they experimented with stumphole whiskey
99,nobody in maycomb had nerve enough to tell mr radley that his boy was in with the wrong crowd
211,one night in an excessive spurt of high spirits the boys backed around the square in a borrowed flivver resisted arrest by maycomb s ancient beadle mr conner and locked him in the courthouse outhouse
400,the town decided something had to be done mr conner said he knew who each and every one of them was and he was bound and determined they wouldnt get away with it so the boys came before the probate judge on charges of disorderly conduct disturbing the peace assault and battery and using abusive and profane language in the presence and hearing of a female
173,the judge asked mr conner why he included the last charge mr conner said they cussed so loud he was sure every lady in maycomb heard them
220,the judge decided to send the boys to the state industrial school where boys were sometimes sent for no other reason than to provide them with food and decent shelter it was no prison and it was no disgrace
24,mr radley thought it was
99,if the judge released arthur mr radley would see to it that arthur gave no further trouble
73,knowing that mr radley s word was his bond the judge was glad to do so
200,the other boys attended the industrial school and received the best secondary education to be had in the state one of them eventually worked his way through engineering school at auburn
149,the doors of the radley house were closed on weekdays as well as sundays and mr radley s boy was not seen again for fifteen years
145,but there came a day barely within jems memory when boo radley was heard from and was seen by several people but not by jem
323,he said atticus never talked much about the radleys when jem would question him atticuss only answer was for him to mind his own business and let the radleys mind theirs they had a right to but when it happened jem said atticus shook his head and said mm mm mm
135, so jem received most of his information from miss stephanie crawford a neighborhood scold who said she knew the whole thing
143,according to miss stephanie boo was sitting in the livingroom cutting some items from the maycomb tribune to paste in his scrapbook
29,his father entered the room
148,as mr radley passed by boo drove the scissors into his parents leg pulled them out wiped them on his pants and resumed his activities
194,mrs radley ran screaming into the street that arthur was killing them all but when the sheriff arrived he found boo still sitting in the livingroom cutting up the tribune
37,he was thirtythree years old then
169,miss stephanie said old mr radley said no radley was going to any asylum when it was suggested that a season in tuscaloosa might be helpful to boo
49,boo wasnt crazy he was highstrung at times
138,it was all right to shut him up mr radley conceded but insisted that boo not be charged with anything he was not a criminal
119,the sheriff hadnt the heart to put him in jail alongside negroes so boo was locked in the courthouse basement
82,boos transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in jems memory
151,miss stephanie crawford said some of the town council told mr radley that if he didnt take boo back boo would die of mold from the damp
67,besides boo could not live forever on the bounty of the county
177,nobody knew what form of intimidation mr radley employed to keep boo out of sight but jem figured that mr radley kept him chained to the bed most of the time
109,atticus said no it wasnt that sort of thing that there were other ways of making people into ghosts
146,my memory came alive to see mrs radley occasionally open the front door walk to the edge of the porch and pour water on her cannas
74,but every day jem and i would see mr radley walking to and from town
93,he was a thin leathery man with colorless eyes so colorless they did not reflect light
98,his cheekbones were sharp and his mouth was wide with a thin upper lip and a full lower lip
178,miss stephanie crawford said he was so upright he took the word of god as his only law and we believed her because mr radleys posture was ramrod straight
21,he never spoke to us
104,when he passed we would look at the ground and say good morning sir and he would cough in reply
152,mr radleys elder son lived in pensacola he came home at christmas and he was one of the few persons we ever saw enter or leave the place
74,from the day mr radley took arthur home people said the house died
192,but there came a day when atticus told us hed wear us out if we made any noise in the yard and commissioned calpurnia to serve in his absence if she heard a sound out of us
18,mr radley was dying
25,he took his time about it
154,wooden sawhorses blocked the road at each end of the radley lot straw was put down on the sidewalk traffic was diverted to the back street
112,dr reynolds parked his car in front of our house and walked to the radleys every time he called
41,jem and i crept around the yard for days
143,at last the sawhorses were taken away and we stood watching from the front porch when mr radley made his final journey past our house
121,there goes the meanest man ever god blew breath into murmured calpurnia and she spat meditatively into the yard
96,we looked at her in surprise for calpurnia rarely commented on the ways of white people
194,the neighborhood thought when mr radley went under boo would come out but it had another think coming boos elder brother returned from pensacola and took mr radleys place
65,the only difference between him and his father was their ages
47,jem said mr nathan radley bought cotton too
147,mr nathan would speak to us however when we said good morning and sometimes we saw him coming from town with a magazine in his hand
167,the more we told dill about the radleys the more he wanted to know the longer he would stand hugging the lightpole on the corner the more he would wonder
47,wonder what he does in there he would murmur
49,looks like hed just stick his head out the door
58, jem said he goes out all right when its pitch dark
157,miss stephanie crawford said she woke up in the middle of the night one time and saw him looking straight through the window at her
47,said his head was like a skull lookin at her
61,aint you ever waked up at night and heard him dill
57,he walks like this jem slid his feet through the gravel
59,why do you think miss rachel locks up so tight at night
162,ive seen his tracks in our back yard many a mornin and one night i heard him scratching on the back screen but he was gone time atticus got there
28, wonder what he looks like
282,jem gave a reasonable description of boo boo was about sixandahalf feet tall judging from his tracks he dined on raw squirrels and any cats he could catch thats why his hands were bloodstained  if you ate an animal raw you could never wash the blood off
159,there was a long jagged scar that ran across his face what teeth he had were yellow and rotten his eyes popped and he drooled most of the time
40,lets try to make him come out said dill
33,id like to see what he looks like
104, jem said if dill wanted to get himself killed all he had to do was go up and knock on the front door
154,our first raid came to pass only because dill bet jem the gray ghost against two tom swifts that jem wouldnt get any farther than the radley gate
50,in all his life jem had never declined a dare
38,jem thought about it for three days
120,i suppose he loved honor more than his head for dill wore him down easily youre scared dill said the first day
36,aint scared just respectful jem said
95,the next day dill said youre too scared even to put your big toe in the front yard
95, jem said he reckoned he wasnt hed passed the radley place every school day of his life
21,always runnin i said
200,but dill got him the third day when he told jem that folks in meridian certainly werent as afraid as the folks in maycomb that hed never seen such scary folks as the ones in maycomb
169,this was enough to make jem march to the corner where he stopped and leaned against the lightpole watching the gate hanging crazily on its homemade hinge
134,i hope youve got it through your head that hell kill us each and every one dill harris said jem when we joined him
47,dont blame me when he gouges your eyes out
24,you started it remember
45, youre still scared murmured dill patiently
164,jem wanted dill to know once and for all that he wasnt scared of anything its just that i cant think of a way to make him come out without him gettin us
48, besides jem had his little sister to think of
43,when he said that i knew he was afraid
142,jem had his little sister to think of the time i dared him to jump off the top of the house if i got killed whatd become of you
117,then he jumped landed unhurt and his sense of responsibility left him until confronted by the radley place
31,you gonna run out on a dare
12, asked dill
71,if you are then dill you have to think about these things jem said
21,lemme think a minute
44,its sort of like making a turtle come out
10, asked dill
26,strike a match under him
84, i told jem if he set fire to the radley house i was going to tell atticus on him
58,dill said striking a match under a turtle was hateful
102,aint hateful just persuades him  s not like youd chunk him in the fire jem growled
41,how do you know a match dont hurt him
36, turtles cant feel stupid said jem
29,were you ever a turtle huh
12, my stars dill
17,now lemme think
21,reckon we can rock him
180, jem stood in thought so long that dill made a mild concession i wont say you ran out on a dare an ill swap you the gray ghost if you just go up and touch the house
14, jem brightened
27,touch the house that all
11, dill nodded
19,sure thats all now
75,i dont want you hollerin something different the minute i get back
24, yeah thats all said dill
169,hell probably come out after you when he sees you in the yard then scoutn mell jump on him and hold him down till we can tell him we aint gonna hurt him
119, we left the corner crossed the side street that ran in front of the radley house and stopped at the gate
55,well go on said dill scout and mes right behind you
38, im going said jem dont hurry me
188, he walked to the corner of the lot then back again studying the simple terrain as if deciding how best to effect an entry frowning and scratching his head
21,then i sneered at him
172,jem threw open the gate and sped to the side of the house slapped it with his palm and ran back past us not waiting to see if his foray was successful
35,dill and i followed on his heels
64,safely on our porch panting and out of breath we looked back
122,the old house was the same droopy and sick but as we stared down the street we thought we saw an inside shutter move
57,a tiny almost invisible movement and the house was still
86,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  dill left us early in september to return to meridian
150,we saw him off on the five oclock bus and i was miserable without him until it occurred to me that i would be starting to school in a week
50,i never looked forward more to anything in my life
344,hours of wintertime had found me in the treehouse looking over at the schoolyard spying on multitudes of children through a twopower telescope jem had given me learning their games following jems red jacket through wriggling circles of blind mans buff secretly sharing their misfortunes and minor victories
21,i longed to join them
173,jem condescended to take me to school the first day a job usually done by ones parents but atticus had said jem would be delighted to show me where my room was
182,i think some money changed hands in this transaction for as we trotted around the corner past the radley place i heard an unfamiliar jingle in jems pockets
333,when we slowed to a walk at the edge of the schoolyard jem was careful to explain that during school hours i was not to bother him i was not to approach him with requests to enact a chapter of tarzan and the ant men to embarrass him with references to his private life or tag along behind him at recess and noon
75,i was to stick with the first grade and he would stick with the fifth
34,in short i was to leave him alone
29,you mean we cant play any more
80,well do like we always do at home he said but youll see  schools different
18, it certainly was
213,before the first morning was over miss caroline fisher our teacher hauled me up to the front of the room and patted the palm of my hand with a ruler then made me stand in the corner until noon
